[{"Place":"Al-Abtah","City":"Makkah al-Mukarramah","Description":"A place in Makkah. Al-Bukhari narrated from Awn ibn Abi Juhayfah from his father who said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) at Al-Abtah, then Bilal came to him and called the adhan for prayer, then Bilal came out with the spear and planted it in front of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) at Al-Abtah and established the prayer. Ibn Hajar said: The Bataha of Makkah, a place outside Makkah, which is called Al-Abtah. In Al-Lisan: The Bataha of the valley and its Abtah are the soft pebbles in the belly of the watercourse, and from it the hadith that he prayed at Al-Abtah, meaning the Abtah of Makkah, which is the watercourse of its valley. Yaqut said: Every watercourse with fine pebbles is an Abtah, and from Abu Zayd: Al-Abtah is the trace of the watercourse, whether narrow or wide. In the poetry of Amr ibn Kulthum in his Mu'allaqah: They crush the heads as the lionesses crush in their Abtah the balls. And he also said: The tribes of Ma'ad know that when we pitch tents in their Abtah. Al-Tabrizi commented: Al-Abtah and Al-Bataha are the belly of the valley with sand and pebbles - as if it is the flat place - so Abtah means the place, and Bataha means the spot. I say: It is clear from what preceded that this name (Abtah) does not mean a specific place; because it applies to a distinct geographical formation wherever it exists, which is every valley course with sand and pebbles, and its location is specified by adding it to a known proper name, like Abtah of Makkah, for example. Poets have mentioned Al-Abatih extensively, especially Abtah of Makkah. Kathir said, and it is attributed to others: When we fulfilled every need from Mina and touched the corners whoever touches, we took the edges of the conversations between us and the necks of the camels flowed to Al-Abatih. I found there the longing of the lost for his riding animals in Makkah while the travelers come and go. Al-Qurashi said: Why not ask about those who settled in the valleys, the best of the valleys and the best navel of the valley, and about those who refused and were not forced to descend the deep places from Ajyad. The people of knowledge will tell you that our houses from them are in good stakes of the pegs. Al-Bakri said: Al-Abtah in Makkah is known, and it is Al-Bataha, and Sulayman ibn Yasar narrated: Abu Rafi' said, and he was in charge of the Prophet's baggage (peace be upon him): He did not order me to descend at Al-Abtah, but I pitched his tent and he descended. In Al-Lisan: Bataha of Makkah and its Abtah are known for their flatness, and Mina is from Al-Abatih, and Quraysh of Al-Bataha are those who settle around Makkah. He said: If only you witnessed me from Quraysh a group, Quraysh of the valleys not Quraysh of the outskirts. From Al-Azhari: Ibn al-A'rabi said: Quraysh of the valleys are those who settle in the ravine between the two mountains of Makkah, and Quraysh of the outskirts are those who settle outside the ravine, and the more honorable of them are Quraysh of the valleys. I say: It appears from what the historians mentioned in what preceded that Al-Abtah, when it comes with the definite article al- and is used absolutely, means Abtah of Makkah due to its fame and the sanctity of its spot. It is clear from the implications of the hadiths that mention Al-Abtah that it means Abtah of Makkah, and it is also its Bataha, and it is noted in some statements that they apply this name to the valley of Makkah, from its upper part in Mina until it passes the lower part of Makkah, and sometimes they make it the name of part of it, its description and determination will come. Therefore, this valley is called Al-Abtah and Al-Bataha due to its geographical formation, and it is called Wadi Ibrahim due to the residence of his descendants in it, and Wadi Makkah due to its location in Makkah. It is what Ibrahim (peace be upon him) meant: (Our Lord, I have settled some of my offspring in an uncultivated valley near Your sacred House) Surah Ibrahim 37. Al-Fakihi specified the location of Al-Abtah from Wadi Makkah saying: As for Al-Abtah, it is said: it is from Masjid al-Haras to the wall of Kharman, that is called Al-Abtah. Its verifier Abdul Malik ibn Duhaysh said: This is a precise determination of what is named Al-Abtah, Masjid al-Haras is Masjid al-Jinn, and as for the wall of Kharman, it is what is called today (al-Kharmaniyyah) and a large part of it has been built as the Capital Secretariat building. I say: Al-Fakihi said about the reason for naming Masjid al-Jinn as Masjid al-Haras: Masjid al-Haras is what is known today, and it was named Masjid al-Haras because the owner of the guard in Makkah would circumambulate and his aides from the ravines of Makkah and its quarters would gather to him at that mosque, so it was named Masjid al-Haras, and it is at the edge of al-Hajun, and it is Masjid al-Jinn. I say: Atiq ibn Ghayth al-Biladi described it geographically from its beginning to its end and mentioned its tributaries saying: Wadi Ibrahim takes its flow from where al-Muhassab flows from Mina, so when it reaches the curve - near the flourishing royal palace - it is named Al-Abtah, then it heads west until it reaches Ri' al-Hajun like a bend, then it turns south and is called Al-Bataha to the Sacred Mosque, as for the common people, they call Al-Abtah (al-Khariq), so when it reaches the Sacred Mosque, it turns to the southwest, and the flood passes in a tunnel dug between the Sacred Mosque and Mount Abi Qubays, so when it passes the Sacred Mosque, it is named (al-Masfalah) to Mount al-Maythab, and Makkah in general, what is above the Sacred Mosque is called al-Mu'alla, and what is after it al-Masfalah. So when the valley passes Mount al-Maythab, it meets Wadi Dhi Tuwa, and its name returns to it (Wadi Ibrahim), then it turns towards the west until it empties into a meadow called Umm al-Hashim, located south straight from al-Hudaybiyah by thirteen kilometers, and it hardly exceeds it, and if it exceeds it, it turns south until it empties into Wadi (Arnah) passing by al-Mansurah, then he talked about its tributaries. I say: It is noted that this Abtah of scholarly and historical fame has changed its features and its Bataha has gone due to the comprehensive urban renaissance in Makkah al-Mukarramah and the paving of its Batahas and roads and covering them with asphalt, so there is no longer in this valley a Bataha that poets chant about and speakers talk about.","Translation":"The story talks about \"Al-Abtah,\" a location in Mecca, characterized by its geographical formation of sand and gravel. It is also called \"Bat'ha Mecca\" or \"Wadi Ibrahim.\" This place was linked to the life of the Prophet, peace be upon him, as mentioned in many hadiths, and it attracted the attention of poets and writers throughout history. Al-Abtah has undergone significant changes due to urban development in Mecca, affecting its landmarks that were the subject of many poems and hadiths."},{"Place":"Al-Abwa'","City":"Between Makkah and Madinah","Description":"A village from the works of al-Fur' from Madinah, and it is said: a mountain. Al-Bukhari narrated from al-Sa'ib ibn Jathama al-Laythi that he gifted the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) a wild donkey while he was at al-Abwa' or Waddan, so he returned it to him, and when he saw what was on his face, he said: We only returned it because we are in ihram. Ibn Hajar said: Al-Abwa' with opening hamza, quiescence of the unified, and extension: a mountain from the work of al-Fur', with fat-ha on fa' and ra', then without dots, it is said: named al-Abwa' for its plague on the heart, and it is said: because the floods inhabit it, meaning settle in it. Al-Bakri said: Al-Abwa' with opening first and extension last: a comprehensive village, and al-Abwa': the mixtures of people. And five miles from it is the mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and at al-Abwa' his mother died, and his first campaigns (peace be upon him) was the campaign of al-Abwa', after twelve months from his arrival in Madinah, intending Banu Damrah and Banu Bakr ibn Abd Manat ibn Kinanah, so Banu Damrah made peace with him, then he returned without meeting any plot. Yaqut said: Al-Abwa' with fat-ha then quiescence and waw and extended alif, some said: named for what is in it of plague, and if so, it would be al-Awba', unless it is inverted. And Thabit ibn Abi Thabit the linguist said: Named al-Abwa' for the floods inhabiting it, and this is better, and Kathir the poet was asked: Why is it named al-Abwa'? He said: Because they inhabited a home in it. And al-Abwa' is a village from the works of al-Fur' from Madinah, between it and al-Juhfah towards Madinah twenty-three miles. It is said: Al-Abwa' is a mountain to the right of Arah, and to the right of the road for the ascender to Makkah from Madinah, and there is a town attributed to this mountain, and its mention came in the hadith of al-Sa'ib ibn Jathama and others. Al-Sukari said: Al-Abwa' is a lofty high mountain with nothing on it of plants except al-Khazm and al-Basham, which is al-Khaza'ah and Damrah. Ibn Qays al-Ruqayyat said: From Mina, then al-Jamar from Abd Shams, desolate, then Baldah, then Hara', then the tents that are in Asfan, deserted from Sulayma, then al-Qa', then al-Abwa'. And at al-Abwa' is the grave of Aminah bint Wahb, the mother of the Prophet, and the reason for her burial there is that Abdullah, the father of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), had gone to Madinah to buy dates and died in Madinah, so his wife Aminah bint Wahb ibn Abd Manaf ibn Zuhrah ibn Kilab ibn Murrah ibn Ka'b ibn Lu'ay ibn Ghalib, would go out every year to Madinah to visit his grave, so when the Messenger of Allah was six years old, she went out visiting his grave with Abd al-Muttalib and Umm Ayman, his nurse, so when she reached al-Abwa' returning to Makkah, she died there, and it is said: Abu Talib visited his maternal uncles Banu al-Najjar in Madinah and carried with him Aminah, the mother of the Messenger of Allah, so when he returned returning to Makkah, she died at al-Abwa'. In al-Maghanim al-Mutabah, al-Majd said: Al-Abwa' with fat-ha and quiescence of the unified below, and fat-ha on waw after it extended alif, then he presented a brief summary of what Yaqut mentioned in his dictionary. And it has preceded. Hamad al-Jasir said: And al-Abwa' is still known, located east of the town of (Masturah) on the road between Makkah and Madinah, and it is about 25 kilometers east of it towards the south, and the distance between it and Rabigh to al-Asafir (24) kilometers, and from al-Asafir to Thaniyat Harshi (6) kilometers, and from Thaniyat Harshi to al-Abwa' (13 kilometers = 43) kilometers. Atiq al-Biladi said: Al-Abwa' is a valley from the valleys of al-Hijaz al-Tihamah, with much water and cultivation, where the valleys of al-Fur' and al-Qahah meet, forming from their meeting Wadi al-Abwa' - like the formation of Wadi Marr al-Zahran from the meeting of the two palms. And Wadi al-Abwa' descends to the sea, leaving the ruins of Waddan on its left, and there is a road to Harshi passing by the town of Masturah then to the sea. And it is called today (Wadi al-Kharibah), but the name al-Abwa' is known among the educated. Its inhabitants are Banu Muhammad from Banu Amr, and Banu Ayyub from al-Baladiyyah from Banu Amr. I say: What preceded from the statements of the scholars indicates that (al-Abwa') is a name for a comprehensive village, a valley with much tamarisk, and a mountain, all meaning one place, which is the village of al-Abwa' and its valley and mountain, and such is common in place names, the name applies to the valley and to the village in it, and to the mountain in it, and likewise to the water sources in it, and to other geographical landmarks in it. These are the al-Abwa' mentioned in the noble hadiths. Al-Abwa' also like the previous, a place from the lands of al-Yamamah near the city of Riyadh, mentioned in the poetry of al-A'sha paired with a number of places near the city of Riyadh, and it came in the poetry of al-A'sha in two different narrations, and the verses from his Mu'allaqah, and in one narration: (al-Abla'), and in the second narration (al-Abwa'), and the correct is: (al-Abwa'). Al-A'sha said: They said: Doubt, then Najd al-Khal its roads, then al-Asjadiyyah, then al-Abwa', then al-Rajl, then al-Safh flows, then Khinzir, then its Barqah until it repels from it the hills and the rope, then it carries from it the water with effort, Rawd al-Qata, then Kathib al-Ghaynah the plain. Thus al-Hamdani presented these verses in this narration then mentioned.. places from the land of al-Yamamah close some to others, including (al-Abwa'), so he said: Khinzir, and Rajlah, and Rawd al-Qata, and Darniy, and Kathib al-Ghaynah, and Aba'ab, and Manfuhah. I say: These places mentioned in al-A'sha's poetry and al-Hamdani talked about, some are still known by their names, like: Namar, Manfuhah, al-Ghaynah. As for the second narration, as al-Bakri presented it, al-A'sha said: So I said to the caravan in Darniy and they were drunk, go on, and how does the drunk goer go? They said: Namar, then Batn al-Khal its roads, then al-Asjadiyyah, then al-Abla', then al-Rajl, then al-Safh flows, then Khinzir, then its Barqah until it repels from it the string and the rope. This is al-Bakri's narration, and he said: And Abu Amr narrated: (then al-Abwa', then al-Rajl). As for al-Tabrizi's narration, he narrated it (al-Abla') and said: And it is narrated (with al-Abwa'). Yaqut said: Abwa: shortened, name for the two villages on the road from Basra to Makkah attributed to Tasm and Jadis, al-Muthaqqab al-Abdi said: Is there a conveyor to Adwan from me, and what avails the threat from afar? If you saw the men of Abwa the morning they donned shaved iron, then you would think the garden of Dhi Arin and the lions of al-Gharifah on the ground. I say: It is known that the homes of Tasm and Jadis were in the land of al-Yamamah, and that extending the shortened and shortening the extended in poetry is a necessity and it is common in their poetry. From what preceded, it is likely that the verse is correct (then al-Abwa'), to confirm the existence of this name in the land of al-Yamamah, and because (al-Abla') is not known in these lands, but this name has become unknown in this era. I have exhausted the discussion of this topic in my book (Dictionary of Places Mentioned in the Ten Mu'allaqat), and explained the error that occurred to one of the researchers; because he relied on one narration. Abwa: with movement shortened, Yaqut said: name of a place or mountain in the Levant, al-Nabighah al-Dhubyani said lamenting his brother: The people will not enjoy what they graze of pasture and what they drive of families and wealth after Ibn Atikah the distant on Abwa, he became in a land with no uncle or maternal uncle, easy character, walker with his cup to the possessors of heights, carrier of burdens, the two friends think the earth is distant between them, this on it and this under it by the.","Translation":"This story talks about the village of Al-Abwa', one of the sites mentioned in the noble hadiths. It is located east of the town of Masturah on the road between Mecca and Medina. It was named after the floods that sweep through it, and it contains geographical features like Mount Al-Abwa' and Wadi Al-Abwa'."},{"Place":"Uhud","City":"Al-Madinah al-Munawwarah","Description":"A well-known mountain in Madinah and it remains known by this name. Al-Bukhari narrated from Abu Humayd al-Sa'idi (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: We campaigned with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) to Tabuk... and he said at the end of his hadith: So the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: I am hastening to Madinah, so whoever wants to hasten with me let him hasten.. Ibn Bakar said a word meaning: When he overlooked Madinah he said: This is Tabah, when he saw Uhud he said: This is a mountain that loves us and we love it. Ibn Kathir said and Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Sulayman ibn Bilal similarly. Al-Bukhari narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) ascended Uhud with Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman, and it shook with them, so he struck it with his foot and said: Be firm Uhud, for upon you is nothing but a prophet or a truthful one or a martyr. In a narration: That the Prophet (peace be upon him) ascended Uhud with Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman, and it shook with them, so he said: Be firm Uhud, for upon you is a prophet, a truthful one, and two martyrs. Al-Suhayli said: Uhud the well-known mountain in Madinah, named for its singularity and separation from other mountains there, and the Messenger (peace be upon him) said about it: This is a mountain that loves us and we love it... and in al-Musnad from the way of Abu Ubays ibn Jabir from the Messenger of Allah: Uhud loves us and we love it, and it is at the gate of Paradise. And it is strengthened by his saying: A man is with whom he loves, with his saying: Loves us and we love it, so these reports correspond, and some strengthen others. Yaqut said: Uhud with damma on first and second together: name of the mountain where the battle of Uhud was, and it is improvised for this mountain, and it is a red mountain without peaks, and between it and Madinah about a mile to its north, and there the incident where Hamzah the uncle of the Prophet was killed, and seventy Muslims, and the Prophet's incisor was broken, his noble face was wounded, and his lip was cut - and it was a day of trial and purification - and that was two years nine months and seven days from the migration of the Prophet, in the year three. In al-Maghanim al-Mutabah, al-Majd said: Uhud with two dammas, a luminous mountain three miles from Madinah, named for its singularity and separation from other mountains there. I say: Mount Uhud is a prominent famous landmark in Madinah, separate from its mountains in its northern side, it has historical fame and literary fame for its virtue and its location from the good Taybah. However the historians differ in determining the distance between it and Madinah, the urban growth at this time has expanded in the various parts of Madinah and crawls to what surrounds it of landmarks including Mount Uhud, for the urban has begun to surround it from its sides. Dictionary of Places Mentioned in Sahih al-Bukhari Even if Uhud had no commendable virtues and merit except the saying of the Prophet: Uhud is a mountain that loves us and we love it, it would suffice. Ibn Shabbah presented a large group of reports that talked about the virtue of Mount Uhud, among them: From Abd al-Rahman al-Aslami, he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Uhud is at a gate from the gates of Paradise. And narrated from Dawud ibn Husayn, he said: The Messenger of Allah said to it: Uhud is on a corner from the corners of Paradise. And from Ishaq ibn Yahya ibn Talhah: That the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Uhud, and Warqan, and Quds, and Radwa from the mountains of Paradise. And from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Uhud is at a gate from the gates of Paradise. And from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) say: This is a mountain that loves us and we love it. This is some of what Ibn Shabbah mentioned in the virtues of Mount Uhud. Al-Samhudi said: And the scholars have statements about the meaning of his saying (peace be upon him): (Loves us and we love it), and mentioned some of these statements and commented on them saying: Al-Hafiz al-Mundhiri said: Al-Baghawi said: The preferred is to take the hadith on its apparent meaning, and it is not denied to describe the inanimates with love for the prophets and people of obedience as the pillar yearned for his separation (peace be upon him) until the people heard its yearning, and as he informed that a stone used to greet him (peace be upon him) before the revelation, so it is not denied that Mount Uhud and all parts of Madinah yearn to meet him, al-Mundhiri said: And it is good. Yaqut presented poetry in love for Mount Uhud and longing for it and said: Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik al-Faq'asi returned to Baghdad and longed for his homeland and mentioned Uhud and others from the surroundings of Madinah so he said: Sleep fled from me and the heart is sad, adversities of concern that do not cease to come, and ailments gathered upon me in Baghdad, and rivers for them a rustling. And the tears of the eye continued to flow their floods from the water, circles for them branches. And it is not fear of death that moistened my tears but the stranger is strange. Oh if only my poetry would I spend a night at Sal' and the doors are not closed upon me. And is Uhud exchanging with us and as if it is a horse in front of the racers a side. The mirage trots the shallow between me and it, so it appears to my eye sometimes and disappears. For my healing is a glance if I look at it to Uhud and the two Harrahs near. And I watch the star until as if I am on every star in the sky a watcher. And I long for the Yemeni lightning if it appears and my longing increases that the south blows. And Ibn Abi Asiyah al-Sulami said, and he is with Ma'n ibn Za'idah in Yemen longing for Madinah: O watcher from behind Ghumdan seeing the peaks of Uhud threw the distant distance. If the disease of despair is with me and a doctor helps me with the spirits of al-Aqiq, he would heal me. And Ubayd Allah ibn Qays al-Ruqayyat said: O master of the travelers from Uhud, greeted from a dwelling and from a support. There is no dwelling like yours except a stagnant, mixed and fearful like the chick huddled. It is fitting here to present a text written by Abd al-Quddus al-Ansari in describing Mount Uhud, he said: As for its natural description, it is a rocky mountain of granite, and its length from east to west six thousand meters, and in it many heads and plateaus various... and from their abundance the viewer almost imagines them as semi-independent mountains, or it seems to him that this Uhud is a chain of large and small connected some to others, and from groups formed the unity of this mountain.. From the adhesion of these mountains and the existence of openings between them formed in the lower parts of Mount Uhud the Maharis which are natural depressions to preserve the water descending from the groups of the upper mountain. And although the color of Mount Uhud is red according to what the author of Mirror of the Two Harams reported, we have found in it plateaus and rocks and veins of different colors.. some tend to blue and some black antimony, and some gray in color and some green. I say: And I did not see in what I reviewed of references what resembles Uhud in its name or approaches it except one place mentioned by Yaqut and did not specify it, named (Ahad). Yaqut said: Ahad: with movement, it may be with the meaning of ahad which is the first of the number, and that it be with the meaning of ahad which is with the meaning of kati and arim and arib, so you say: There is no one in the house, as you say there is no kati' in the house, nor arib in the house. It is said it is a place in Najd, and it is said al-Ahad with tashdid on dal a mountain mentioned in their poetry. And there is another place named (Wahid). Yaqut said with the word of the number one a mountain for Kalb, Amr ibn al-Ada' al-Ajdari then al-Kalbi said: Oh if only my poetry would I spend a night at Anbat or at the meadow east of Wahid, in a place generous with spring its meadows, short in it the night of the virgins the sleepers, where you see the bare fast horses our lads leading them with the collars. I say: And this Wahid located in the lands of Kalb is a single isolated mountain with no mountains around it, Sheikh Hamad al-Jasir talked about it saying: It appears that this Wahid is Mount al-Markuz - from rakz - and it is a small rounded mountain prominent - with nothing of mountains near it - if you are in al-Dawid it is there in the southeast you see it with the eye, and the distance between them approaches twenty kilometers, and it is located from al-Rawd Ahad waters of al-Hazul north, and the pipeline surrounds it after passing the town of Rafha and before reaching al-Uwayqilah, and it is located south of this by about fifty kilometers, east of al-Hazul (Huzn Kalb anciently).","Translation":"The story talks about Mount Uhud in Medina, which the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and his companions loved, and it loved them. The Prophet, peace be upon him, mentioned many hadiths confirming the mountain's love for them and their love for it, making it a distinguished place in Islamic history."},{"Place":"Al-Akhsaban","City":"Makkah al-Mukarramah","Description":"First hamza open, then kha' with dots quiescent, then shin with three dots open, then unified ba' after it alif and ending with unified nun, dual of akhshab: two mountains in Makkah. Al-Bukhari narrated from Aishah the wife of the Prophet that she said to the Prophet: Has a day come upon you harsher than the day of Uhud? He said: I have met from your people what I met, and the harshest I met from them was the day of al-Aqabah Dictionary of Places Mentioned in Sahih al-Bukhari when I presented myself to Ibn Abd Yalil ibn Abd Kulal and he did not respond to me as I wanted, so I departed grieved on my face, and I did not recover until I was at Qarn al-Tha'alib, then I raised my head and behold a cloud had shaded me, so I looked and behold in it Jibril, so he called me and said: Allah has heard the saying of your people to you and what they returned to you, and He has sent to you the angel of the mountains to order him with what you want in them, so the angel of the mountains called me and greeted me then said: O Muhammad, that is in what you want, if you want I will collapse upon them al-Akhsabayn, so the Prophet said: «Rather I hope that Allah will bring forth from their loins those who worship Allah alone not associating anything with Him». Ibn Hajar said: Al-Akhsaban, with two with dots: they are the two mountains of Makkah, Abu Qubays and the one opposite it as if it is Qu'ayqi'an, and al-Saghani said: Rather it is the red mountain that overlooks Qu'ayqi'an, and mistaken who said it is Thawr, like al-Kirmani, and they were named for their hardness and the coarseness of their stones. Al-Azraqi said, Abu al-Walid said: The Akhsab of Makkah are Abu Qubays and it is the mountain overlooking al-Safa to (al-Suwayda') to (al-Khandamah) and it was called in Jahiliyyah (al-Amin) and it is said: Named al-Amin; because the Black Stone was deposited in it during the year of the flood, so when Ibrahim and Ismail built the House, it was called that the Stone is from me in such and such place... Abu al-Wali said: And it reached me from some people of knowledge from the people of Makkah that he said: Named Abu Qubays because a man first to rise building in it was called Abu Qubays, so when he ascended in it the building it was named Mount Abu Qubays, and it is said he acquired the Stone from it so named Abu Qubays, and the first is more famous among the people of Makkah. And the other Akhshab the mountain called: (al-Ahmar) and it was called in Jahiliyyah (al-A'raf) and it is the mountain whose face overlooks (Qu'ayqi'an). Al-Bakri said: Al-Akhshab with shin with dots and ba' with one dot, on the pattern af'al and they are four Akhashib, so the Akhsab of Makkah its two mountains, and the Akhsab of Madinah, its two lavas surrounding it and they are its two labata.. . Abdullah ibn Umar said what the Messenger of Allah said: When you are between al-Akhsabayn from Mina - and he gestured with his hand towards the east - for there is a valley called al-Sharar, with a tree under which seventy prophets were born. And it is said: Akhshab and Khashabah, on the feminine, Ka'b ibn Malik said: So ask the people may you not care about us the day the flood flowed at al-Ma'lamayn Kada' and Khashaba' called when it saw us and Khashaba' hid from fear of us. And saw what we met from Hara' so called its Lord with safety Hara'. Al-Zubayr said: Al-Akhsaban and al-Jabjaban: two mountains of Makkah, and it is said: What is between its two Jabjab is more honorable than so-and-so. Yaqut said: Al-Akhashib: with shin with dots, and ba' and unified, and al-Akhshab from the mountains the rough coarse, and it is said: it is that which is not climbed, and land khashabah and it is whose stones are scattered close, Abu al-Najm said: If they ascend al-Akhshab al-Mantuh intending as if it butted and the coarse coarse from everything, and man khashab: bare bone. And al-Akhashib: mountains of Makkah and mountains of Mina. And al-Akhsaban two mountains added sometimes to Makkah and sometimes to Mina, and they are one: Abu Qubays and Qu'ayqi'an. And it is said: Rather they are Abu Qubays and the red mountain overlooking here for you, and they are also called al-Jabjabayn. Ibn Wahb said: Al-Akhsaban the two mountains under al-Aqabah at Mina, and Sayyid Ali al-Alawi said: The eastern Akhshab Abu Qubays, and the western Akhshab is known as Mount al-Khatt and al-Khatt from Wadi Ibrahim. Al-Asma'i said: Al-Akhsaban Abu Qubays, and it is the mountain overlooking al-Safa and it is what is between the edge of small Ajyad overlooking al-Safa to al-Suwayda' that follows al-Khandamah, and it was called in Jahiliyyah al-Amin; because the Stone was deposited in it during the year of the flood, so when Ismail built the House it was called: The Stone is in such and such place. And the other Akhshab the mountain called al-Ahmar was called in Jahiliyyah al-A'raf, and it is the mountain whose face overlooks Qu'ayqi'an. From the poetry said in them the saying of al-Sharif al-Radi Abu al-Hasan Muhammad ibn al-Husayn ibn Musa ibn Muhammad ibn Musa ibn Ibrahim ibn Musa ibn Ja'far ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib to him: I love you as long as Mina and Jam' stand and as long as the two Akhsab of Makkah are anchored and as long as they sacrifice at Khayf Mina and fall on the chins the hair of its Mash'ar. Your look a look at al-Khayf that was clearing the eye or was its mote and there was no other than our position and flew with every tribe from us its seeds. And this dual is unique, so it is said to each one of them: al-Akhshab, Sa'idah ibn Juwayyah said: Or in and their gifts and every gift from what the ribs prepare Thath'ab and their stay if good at Ma'zam narrow thousand and their chests the Akhshab. And Sayfi ibn Amir said, and he is Abu Qays ibn al-Aslat al-Khazraji and he is Jahili meaning Quraysh: Stand and pray to your Lord and seek refuge at the corners of this House between al-Akhashib. Al-Azraqi narrated and my grandfather narrated to me from Muslim ibn Khalid from Ibn Khaytham from Yusuf ibn Mahik who said: I was sitting with Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-As in a side of the Sacred Mosque when he looked at a house overlooking Abu Qubays and said: Do you deny that? I said: Yes, he said: If you see its houses - meaning Makkah - have risen above its Akhsab, and rivers have flowed in its bellies, then the matter has approached, Abu al-Walid said: My grandfather said when al-Abbas ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abdullah ibn Abbas built his house in Makkah at al-Sayyarifah opposite the Sacred Mosque he ordered his people not to raise it so they overlook the Ka'bah, and to make its top below the Ka'bah to honor the Ka'bah that it not overlook it, my grandfather said: So no house remained in Makkah for a sultan or others around the Sacred Mosque overlooking the Ka'bah except it was demolished or lowered except this house for it is on its state to this day. I say: It is understood from what preceded of the statements of the scholars in defining al-Akhsabayn and determining their location that al-Akhshab is a generic name applied to every rough coarse mountain difficult to climb, and therefore the location of al-Akhsabayn is not determined except by adding them to a known proper name: like Akhsab of Makkah, and Akhsab of Mina, and the locations of these mountains have been determined in the preceding statements of the scholars, and if collected before them: al-Akhashib plural of akhshab as preceded in the statements of the scholars Dictionary of Places Mentioned in Sahih al-Bukhari and in what they presented of poetic evidences, specific to Akhsab of Makkah and Akhsab of Mina. As for Yaqut's saying about Akhsab of Makkah and Akhsab of Mina: Two mountains added sometimes to Makkah, sometimes to Mina, and they are one. It is a saying not to be relied upon; because it opposes the statements of the scholars in determining and defining these mountains. Although Yaqut in the entry (al-Akhashib) distinguished between Akhsab of Makkah and Akhsab of Mina, contrary to what he said in what preceded, so he said: And al-Akhashib mountains of Makkah and mountains of Mina. And what indicates that al-Akhshab is a generic name for every rough coarse mountain is what will come of the multiplicity of these names in other places in the Arabian Peninsula. Al-Bakri said and Akhsab of Madinah its two lavas surrounding it, and they are its two labata. And he also said and Akhashib al-Siman: mountains gathered at al-Siman, in the locale of Banu Tamim with no hill or mountain near it. Yaqut said and al-Akhashib: black mountains near Aja between them a short sand, from Nasr. And Yaqut presented in the entry (al-Akhshabayn) poetry of al-Muzahim al-Uqayli who said: My two friends is there a way you know that brings Layla to us our stratagem, for at the top of al-Akhsabayn an arak tree prevented me from it the war near its shade, and in its branch if its side is sought honey that the gatherer gathers if he reaches it, forbidden in some of its branches the high, its phantom comes to us every time. Yaqut said and it appears from this poetry that al-Akhsabayn in it other than those in Makkah, it indicates that they are from the homes of the Arabs that they inhabit with their families, and al-Akhsabayn are not like that. I say: From what preceded it is clear that al-Akhsabayn mentioned in the noble hadith are: Akhsab of Makkah, and that the two mountains of Mina are called: al-Akhsabayn. As for the other places mentioned by Yaqut and al-Bakri, they are scattered landmarks in Najd. Atiq al-Biladi talked about al-Akhsabayn so he said in his talk: The known today that al-Akhsabayn are the two mountains between which the road passes the night of the departure from Arafah, and they are the limit of Muzdalifah from the east and the northern is called al-Akhshab al-Kabir, and the southern al-Akhshab al-Saghir, and their road is called Tariq al-Ma'zimayn and Tariq al-Akhsabayn, and it is a narrow pass, and it has been widened and made three roads for cars and a road for pedestrians... and the summary, that Akhsab of Makkah are Abu Qubays and Qu'ayqi'an and al-Ahmar is not from them, and Akhsab of Mina are: al-Qabil and al-Sabih - see them - and Akhsab of Muzdalifah the preceding mention are them.","Translation":"The story talks about Al-Akhsaban, two mountains in Mecca sometimes called Akhsabi Mecca and Akhsabi Mina. Other mountains in different regions of the Arabian Peninsula are known by the same name, and they were mentioned in hadiths and poetry. Al-Akhsab is the plural of khashba, which is rough land with scattered stones."},{"Place":"Ard Thamud","City":"Al-Hijr","Description":"Al-Bukhari narrated with his chain from Abdullah ibn Umar he said: I sold from the Commander of the Believers Uthman property in the valley for his property in Khaybar, so when we contracted I turned on my heel until I exited his house fearing he wants me the sale and the Sunnah was that the contractors have the option until they separate, Abdullah said: So when my sale and his were obligatory I saw that I had cheated him by driving him to the land of Thamud in three nights, and he drove me to Madinah in three nights. I say: The intended by the valley in this hadith is Wadi al-Qura, and it is also the lands of Thamud. Ibn Hajar said: The valley: means Wadi al-Qura, and his saying: (drove him to the land of Thamud in three nights) meaning I increased the distance between him and his land that became to him over the distance that was between him and his land he sold in three nights. And his saying: (and drove me to Madinah in three nights) meaning that he decreased the distance between me and my land I took with it from the distance that was between me and my land I sold in three nights, and he said to Madinah because both were in it, so Ibn Umar saw the advantage in the proximity to Madinah, and that is that Ibn Umar's land he sold to Uthman was in Wadi al-Qura, and the land of the Commander of the Believers Uthman he sold to Ibn Umar was in Khaybar so Ibn Umar's land approached him in Khaybar by a distance of three days, and the land of the Commander of the Believers Uthman distanced by a distance of three days north; because it became in Wadi al-Qura. And by this it appears that the distance between Madinah and the nearest Wadi al-Qura is a journey of six nights, and that Khaybar is in the middle of this distance. I have exhausted the talk about the lands of Thamud in the entry (al-Hijr) and in the entry (Wadi al-Qura) - so see them.","Translation":"This story talks about buying and selling land between Abdullah bin Umar and Uthman bin Affan, may God be pleased with them. They discuss the difference in distance between the sold and bought land and how it affects travel between them, explaining that Wadi Al-Qura is six nights away from Medina and Khaibar is in the middle of that distance."},{"Place":"Al-Ard al-Muqaddasah","City":"Palestine","Description":"A description for the land described by it to distinguish it. And differed in its determination so it was said: al-Tur, and said: Jericho, and said: al-Sham, and said: Palestine and Damascus and what around it. Allah said informing about His prophet Musa: (O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned) Surah al-Ma'idah 21, and al-Bukhari narrated with his chain from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The angel of death was sent to Musa (peace be upon him) so when he came to him he struck him and returned to his Lord and said: You sent me to a servant who does not want death, He said: Return to him and tell him to place his hand on the back of an ox, so for him by what his hand covers by every hair a year. He said O Lord then what He said then death He said now so he asked Allah to bring him near to the Holy Land a stone's throw. Ibn Hajar said: The sought is proximity to the prophets buried in Bayt al-Maqdis, and that is what Iyadh preferred. This is what Musa (peace be upon him) intended when he asked his Lord to bring him near to the Holy Land a stone's throw. Ibn Kathir said: The Holy Land: meaning the purified, and Sufyan al-Thawri said from al-A'mash from Mujahid from Ibn Abbas in His saying: (enter the Holy Land) he said: It is al-Tur and what around it, and likewise Mujahid and others said. And Sufyan al-Thawri narrated from Abu Sa'id al-Baqqal from Ikrimah from Ibn Abbas who said: It is Jericho, and likewise mentioned from more than one of the interpreters, and in this a look; because Jericho is not the intended by the conquest, nor was it in their path to Bayt al-Maqdis and they came from the lands of Egypt, when Allah destroyed their enemy Pharaoh, unless the intended by Jericho is the land of Bayt al-Maqdis, as al-Suddi said in what Ibn Jarir narrated from him, not that the intended is this known town at the edge of al-Tur east of Bayt al-Maqdis. Ibn Jarir said in interpreting His saying exalted: (O my people enter the Holy Land which Allah assigned) : This is news from Allah exalted about the saying of Musa (peace be upon him) to his people Banu Isra'il, and his ordering them - by the order of Allah to him - by ordering them to enter the Holy Land. Then the people of interpretation differed in interpreting His saying: (the Holy Land). Some said: Intended by it al-Tur and what around it and it is a narration with his chain from Mujahid. And narrated with his chain from Ibn Abbas: (enter the Holy Land) he said: al-Tur and what around it. And others said: It is al-Sham narrated that with his chain from Qatadah. And others said: It is the land of Jericho. And narrated with his chain from Ibn Zayd in His saying: enter the Holy Land he said: al-Tur and what around it. And narrated with his chain from al-Suddi who said: It is Jericho. And narrated with his chain from Ikrimah from Ibn Abbas who said: It is Jericho. And said: That the Holy Land Damascus and Palestine and some of Jordan. And intended by His saying (the Holy) : the purified the blessed. And narrated with his chain from Mujahid the Holy Land he said: the blessed. And said: And the preferred of the sayings in that to be correct is to say: It is the Holy Land as the prophet of Allah Musa said; because the saying in that that it is a land other than a land, its true correctness is not reached except by the report and no report by that it is permissible to cut testimony by it. Except that it does not exit from being from the land that is between the Euphrates, and Arish of Egypt for the consensus of all people of interpretation and biographies and scholars by reports on that. Al-Qurtubi said: (the Holy) meaning the purified. Mujahid: the blessed, and blessing is purification from drought and hunger and others. Qatadah it is al-Sham Mujahid: al-Tur and what around it. Ibn Abbas and al-Suddi and Ibn Zayd: It is Jericho. Al-Zujaj Damascus and Palestine and some of Jordan. And Qatadah's saying gathers all this. Yaqut said: The Holy Land: it is the blessed the sanctified, said: It is Damascus and Palestine and some of Jordan and Bayt al-Maqdis from it. I say: This is what the interpreters said in determining the Holy Land with difference between them, and al-Qurtubi preferred what Qatadah said: It is the land of al-Sham, for including what others said, especially Bayt al-Maqdis.","Translation":"This story talks about the Prophet Moses, peace be upon him, asking God to bring him close to the Holy Land by a stone's throw. Scholars differed in identifying the Holy Land, but most agreed that it includes part of the Levant and Jerusalem, and Al-Qurtubi favored Qatadah's opinion that it is the land of the Levant as it encompasses what other interpreters said."},{"Place":"Iram Dhat al-Imad","City":"Yemen","Description":"City of Shaddad ibn Ad in Yemen according to some scholars. Allah exalted said: (Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with 'Ad (6) Iram of the pillars (7)) Surah al-Fajr verse 7. Al-Bukhari said: Mujahid said: Iram of the pillars the ancient, and the pillars people of tent do not settle. Ibn Jarir said and the people of interpretation differed in interpreting His saying: (Iram) some said: It is name of a town, then those who said that differed in the town intended by that, so some said: Intended Alexandria. And narrated with his chain from al-Qurtubi that he says: (Iram of the pillars) Alexandria. Said: And others said: It is Damascus. And narrated with his chain said: The ancient. From Mujahid, His saying: (Iram) and others said that tribe from Ad. And others said: Iram, the perished. Said: And the correct of the saying in that to say: That Iram either a town Ad inhabited, so therefore returned to Ad for following it, or name of a tribe. And as for what mentioned from Mujahid, that he said: Intended by it the ancient, a saying with no meaning. And the most resembling the sayings in it to the correct in my opinion: that it is name of a tribe from Ad, and therefore the reading came without adding Ad to it, and without running it. And His saying: (of the pillars) the people of interpretation differed in the meaning of His saying: (of the pillars) in this place, so some said: Meaning: of the length, and they went in that to the saying of the Arabs to the tall man: man mu'ammad, and said: They were tall bodies. And some said rather said to them: (of the pillars) because they were people of tents, they seek the rains and move to the grass wherever it is, then return to their homes. And others said rather said that to them for building built by some of them so he strengthened its pillars and raised its buildings. And the most resembling the sayings in that to what the apparent of the revelation indicates, the saying of who said: Intended by that that they were people of traveling tents; because the known in the speech of the Arabs from the pillars what the tents are pillared with of wood, and the columns that the building is carried upon, and no building is known for them with pillars by a sound report. Ibn Kathir said in his interpretation His saying exalted: (of the pillars) because they inhabited hair houses raised by strong pillars, and they were the strongest people in their time creation and the strongest of them in might, and therefore Hud mentioned them with that blessing, and guided them to use it in obedience to their Lord who created them. Mujahid said: Iram an ancient nation meaning Ad the first, Qatadah ibn Di'amah and al-Suddi said: That Iram house of kingdom of Ad and this is a good strong saying, and Mujahid and Qatadah and al-Kalbi said in His saying:(of the pillars) they were people of tents do not settle, and al-Awfi said from Ibn Abbas: Only said to them of the pillars for their length, and Ibn Jarir chose the first and rejected the second so he hit it. Ibn Kathir said then on every saying whether the pillars buildings they built or pillars of their houses for the Bedouins or weapons they fight with or the length of one of them so they are a tribe and a nation from the nations so they are the mentioned in the Quran in more than one place the paired with Thamud and Allah knows best. And who claimed that the intended by His saying:(Iram of the pillars) a city either Damascus as narrated from Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib and Ikrimah, or Alexandria as narrated from al-Qurtubi or others so in it a look, for how does the speech fit on this: (Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with 'Ad (6) Iram of the pillars (7)) that he made that a substitute or appositive. For the speech does not fit then, then the intended is only the news of the destruction of the tribe named Ad and what Allah afflicted them of His punishment that is not repelled, not that the intended is the news of a city or region. And I only alerted to that lest many of what the group of interpreters mentioned at this verse about mentioning a city called: Iram of the pillars, built with bricks of gold and silver, its palaces and houses and gardens, and that its gravel is pearls and jewels, and its soil balls of musk, and its rivers flowing, and its fruits falling, and its houses without inhabitants, and its wall and doors whistle, with no caller nor responder, and that it moves sometimes in the land of al-Sham, sometimes in Yemen, sometimes in Iraq, sometimes in other than that of the lands, for this all from the fables of the Israelites, from the fabrication of some of their heretics to test by that the saying of the ignorant people to believe them in all that. And al-Tha'alibi and others mentioned that a man from the Bedouins and he is Abdullah ibn Qilabah, in the time of Mu'awiyah went in search of his stray camels so while he is wandering in seeking them behold he came upon a great city with wall and doors so he entered it and found in it close to what we mentioned, of descriptions of the golden city that preceded mention, and that he returned and informed the people so they went with him to the place he said and saw nothing. . . so this story its chain is not sound even if sound to that Bedouin, perhaps he fabricated that, or that a kind of hallucination and imagination afflicted him, so he believed that it has reality externally and it is not so, and this is what is cut by its unsoundness. And Ibn Ishaq said they were Arabs and their home was Wadi al-Qura. Yaqut said: Iram of the pillars and it is Iram Ad, added and not added, I mean His saying exalted: (Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with 'Ad (6) Iram of the pillars (7)) so who added did not decline Iram; because he makes it name of their mother, or name of a town, and who did not add made Iram its name and did not decline it; because he made Ad name of their father, and Iram name of the tribe, and made it a substitute for it. And some said: Iram does not decline for definition and feminization because it is name of a tribe, so on this the estimation is: - Iram owner of of the pillars, because of the pillars a city. And said: of the pillars description, as you say the city of the king. - And said: Iram a city, so on this the estimation with Ad owner of Iram. And read with Ad Iram of the pillars, the genitive on the addition so this its syntax, then differed in it who made it a city, so some said: It is a land that was and perished, so it is not known. And some said: It is Alexandria, and most say: It is Damascus, and likewise Shabib ibn Yazid ibn al-Nu'man ibn Bashir said: If not for the one that attached me from its attachments I would not have touched Iram a home nor a homeland. They said: He meant Damascus, and with it al-Buhturi meant by his saying: To you we drove the she-camels from the land of Babel we cross it the direction of the north and guide, so how much we suffered from depression after depression and how much we crossed from desert after desert seeking you from the mother of Iraq inclinations with us, and the palaces of al-Sham from you on watch to Iram of the pillars and that it the place my intention frightened and intentional. And al-Zamakhshari related that Iram a land from it Alexandria. And others narrated that Iram of the pillars which was not created like it in the lands, in Yemen between Hadramawt and Sana'a, from the building of Shaddad ibn Ad and they narrated that Shaddad ibn Ad was a tyrant, and when he heard of Paradise and what Allah prepared in it for His friends of palaces of gold and silver, and dwellings under which rivers flow, and chambers above which chambers, he said to his grandees: I am making in the earth a city on the description of Paradise so he delegated that to a hundred men from his agents and qahramanat under the hand of each man from them a thousand from the helpers and ordered them to seek a spacious plain from the land of Yemen and choose its best soil, and enabled them the moneys and exemplified for them how to work, and wrote to his three agents: Ghanim ibn Alwan, and al-Dahhak ibn Alwan, and al-Walid ibn al-Rayan ordering them to write to their agents in the horizons of their countries to gather all what is in their land from gold and silver and pearls and ruby and musk and amber and saffron so they send with it to him. Then he sent to all the mines and extracted what in them from gold and silver. Then he sent his three agents to the divers to the seas and they extracted the jewels, that so they gathered from them like the mountains, and carried all to Shaddad then they sent the diggers to the mines of ruby and peridot, and all jewels so they extracted from them a great matter. So he ordered with the gold so it was struck like bricks then built with that that city, and ordered with the pearls and ruby and onyx and peridot and agate so he inlaid with it its walls, and made for it chambers above it chambers pillared all that with columns of peridot and onyx and ruby, then flowed under the city a valley he directed it to it from under the earth forty parasangs, like the great canal. Then he ordered so he flowed from that valley branches in those streets and avenues and alleys flowing with clear water. And ordered the edges of that river and all the branches painted with red gold... then built himself in the middle of the city on the shore of that river a lofty high palace overlooking all those palaces, and made its door opening to the valley in a spacious wide place, and erected upon it two leaves from gold inlaid with kinds of rubies... and stayed in building it five hundred years. And that Allah exalted loved to take the argument upon him and upon his soldiers by the message and the call to repentance and turning so He selected for His message to him Hud (peace be upon him), and he was from the core of his people and their noblest... then Hud (peace be upon him), came to him and called him to Allah exalted and ordered him with faith and acknowledgment of the lordship of Allah exalted, and His oneness, so he persisted in disbelief and tyranny and that when his kingdom completed seven hundred years. So Hud warned him of the punishment and cautioned him and frightened him the removal of his kingdom so he did not deter from what he was upon, and the delegated with building the city met him, and informed him of the completion from it so he resolved to go out to it in his soldiers so he went out in three hundred thousand from his guard and shakiriyyah and allies and marched towards it and left on his kingdom in Hadramawt and all the land of the Arabs his son Mur'id ibn Shaddad, and Mur'id was it is said believer in Hud - peace be upon him - so when Shaddad approached the city and reached a stage from it came a cry from the sky so he died he and his companions all... and Yaqut sealed this story which we presented summarized from what came in it saying: I say: This story from what we preceded the disclaimer from its soundness and we thought that it from the news of the storytellers the embellished and their fabricated ornamented. I say: This some of what Ibn Kathir and others from the scholars mentioned about Iram of the pillars, and it is clear in what we mentioned from the statements of the scholars the difference in the reality of Iram of the pillars, its description and location, and is it a city or a tribe? Although Ibn Kathir approved the saying of Qatadah and al-Suddi: That Iram of the pillars house of kingdom of Ad, and Allah knows best.","Translation":"The story talks about the city of \"Iram of the Pillars\" mentioned in the Holy Quran, addressing scholars' differences about its location and whether it was a city or a tribe. It also covers the legend of building the city with gold, silver, and jewels, and historians' differences about its actual location and whether it was a real city or a myth from Israelite storytellers."},{"Place":"Ariha","City":"Palestine","Description":"Opening hamza, ra' without dots kasra, then ya' with two dots quiescent after it ha' without dots then extended alif: a town in al-Ghawr from the land of Jordan.

Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj mentioned it. Ibn al-Athir said: Then Allah exalted ordered Musa peace be upon him , to march with Banu Isra'il to Ariha town of the giants and it is the Holy Land.

Ibn Hajar said: Atam of Madinah with extension plural of atm with two dammas and they are the fortresses built with stones. And said: It is every square flat house, and al-atam plural of few, and plural of many utum, and the feminine atmah like akmah. And al-Zubayr ibn Bakkar mentioned in Akhbar al-Madinah what was in it of atam before the Aws and Khazraj settled in it, then what was in it after their settlement and prolonged in that. Yaqut said: Al-Atm: said with two dammas and with damma then quiescence, and al-atm and al-ajm with one meaning, and the plural atam and ajam: and they are the fortresses, and mostly named by this name the fortresses of Madinah, and may be said for others also , Aws ibn Maghra' said: Spread the soldiers for them in the earth killing them what between Busra to atam of Najran. Zayd al-Khayl al-Ta'i said: Camped at atam of Madinah four and ten a singer above it the night a bird, so when our companions fulfilled every need and a writer wrote a book in Madinah, I tightened upon it its saddle and its shawl from the chaff and the barley and the belly emaciated. I say and atam of Madinah many famous historians talked about them, some have a name known by like: Al-Aghlab: with ghayn with dots built by Banu Sawad ibn Ghanm ibn Ka'b was on the mound upon which the stones that the water carriers rest upon when they overflow in the alley of Rumah to Bathan, was for Amr ibn Abad ibn Amr ibn Sawad Abi al-Yasar. And Khayt with the word one the threads: atm in Madinah built by Banu Sawad ibn Ghanm, its place was in the east of Masjid al-Qiblatayn on a prominence of the lava at the end of the path, from the land of Banu Salimah was al-Sahl ibn Qays ibn Abi Ka'b ibn al-Qayn ibn Ka'b ibn Sawad. And al-Muja with fat-ha and jim: atm in Madinah for Banu Wa'il ibn Zayd ibn Qays ibn Amir ibn Murrah ibn Malik ibn al-Aws in their house they were in, and they built (al-Adhq) also . I say: And like this much in the names of atam in Madinah, and some named by the name of its owner attributed to him so said atm of Banu so-and-so. And al-Suhayli talked: about some atm of Madinah so said: And mentioned in the hadith of Abdullah ibn Abi that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) passed by him, and he in the shade of Muzahim atmah, and atam of Madinah: roofs and they have names, so from them Muzahim, and from them al-Zawra' atm of Banu al-Jalah, and from them Ma'rid atm of Banu Sa'idah, and from them Fari' atm of Banu Hudaylah, and from them Mas'at, and Waqim, and in Ma'rid the poet says: And we protected from Bada'ah all of it and we built Ma'rid so it is overlooking so it became inhabited long its top and atam in it ruined and broken and Bada'ah land of Banu Sa'idah, and to it is attributed Bir Bada'ah.

I say: This is what was possible for me to define from the homes of my tribes Aws and Khazraj, and their atam, and al-Samhudi relied in his talk about atam of Madinah and the homes of its tribes on what the historians Ibn Zabalah, and Ibn Shabbah, and al-Matri, and Ibn al-Najjar and others mentioned, and he was keen in his talk to gather between the statements of who preceded him, and sought the preferred from them and helped with some of his observations in these lands. And Abd al-Quddus al-Ansari talked about atam of Madinah and said in his talk and it was hoped that the hand of days leaves us a group of the many fortresses and atam, but it did not leave except three: the fortress of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, and atm al-Dahyan, and atm of Abi Dujanah ibn Simak. And said in describing atm of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf: Stands on a plateau from the southern eastern lava of Madinah, and its length 33 meters in width 33 meters and height of what remains of its walls four meters and their thickness a meter and it has one door in the western side and eight huge towers, their building from huge stones adhering some to others directly, and the length of some 140 centimeters, and width 80 centimeters, and thickness 40 centimeters. And no trace in it for inscriptions nor for decoration, military building fortified, and in its middle a wide square courtyard its area a thousand square meters, and it not paved nor tiled, so the lava rocks protruding in it, and between them depressions and elevations, and at the sides of the fortress from inside ten rooms different sizes, and its tops ruined. And in the southern side outside the fortress a well adjacent to it, and it collapsed with the length of time and entered to it from inside the fortress by a stone ladder the drawers descend from it, and the soil and stones have filled the entrance and the ladder. And said in describing atm al-Dahyan: Great atm built with black lava stones, its length about 27 meters in width twelve meters, and its height about eight meters, and its southern part has fallen until almost its trace erased. As for the northern part it still coherent high with scattering much of its upper stones, and for its hugeness no great effect appeared for this scattering, and it located at al-Arsah located west of Bir Shamilah and north of al-Asabah... and atm al-Dahyan Jahili like most atam of Madinah. And said in describing atm of Abi Dujanah: That the remaining ruin of this solid building similar in its shape and roundness to atm al-Dahyan, and the existing in the northern side of the square wall in a depression from the land near the alley leading to the hotel of Al al-Madani which became a school for girls.. and which falls actually in the northwest of Bir Bada'ah, and it is the remains of atm of Abi Dujanah al-Ansari al-Sa'idi. And Abd al-Quddus al-Ansari published in his book pictures for these three atam he talked about. I say: And with what we presented I suffice in talking about atam of Madinah and they more than what I mentioned, this in relation to the atam of Aws and Khazraj. As for the atam of the Jews they also many and I did not address mentioning anything from them , and the historians who cared for the history of Madinah talked about them, and exhausted talking about them with what suffices.","Translation":"This story talks about the role of stone fortresses (Al-Atam) in the Islamic city and how they were built with stones for fortification. The Atam were built by the Aws and Khazraj tribes to protect them and strengthen their power against seditions and conflicts, and they played an important role in their daily lives."},{"Place":"Atm Banu Mughalah","City":"Al-Madinah al-Munawwarah","Description":"Al-Atm preceded its marking and definition. And Banu Mughalah a clan from the Ansar in Madinah. And al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih from Ibn Umar - in the news of Ibn Sayyad - that the Prophet (peace be upon him) found him playing with the boys at atm of Banu Mughalah. Ibn Hajar said: Atm, with two dammas building like the fortress, and Mughalah with fat-ha on mim and the light ghayn clan from the Ansar. Al-Samhudi said: Banu Mughalah - they are Banu Adi ibn Amr ibn Malik ibn al-Najjar - and Mughalah their mother, built an atm called: Fari', and it is the atm facing the houses of Banu Talhah ibn Ubayd Allah, entered in dar Ja'far ibn Yahya ibn Khalid ibn Barmak and to it Hassan ibn Thabit says: I stayed awake for the flashing of the flashing lightning and we consult between Sal' and Fari'. Ibn Zabalah said: And al-Zayn al-Maraghi said: That this atm was for Thabit father of Hassan ibn Thabit. And this Fari' is the atm where Safiyyah aunt of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was the day of al-Khandaq and with her Hassan. And in the sixth door door that was facing dar Ja'far ibn Yahya ibn Khalid ibn Barmak, and entered in his this house Fari' atm of Hassan ibn Thabit as Ibn Zabalah said, and in its place today the Kalbariyyah school which the sultan Shahab al-Din Ahmad sultan of Kalbariyyah from the lands of India established in the year thirty-eight and eight hundred, and this door entered in the wall at its renewal. Al-Shanqiti said: Atm of Hassan ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) and his house and this atm was called al-Fari', and its location at the place of Bab al-Rahmah today, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to enter his family in this fortress if fighting occurred around al-Madinah al-Munawwarah, as happened in the battle of Uhud and al-Khandaq, and this fortress is which in it Safiyyah aunt of the Messenger (peace be upon him) killed the Jew who came spying the privacies of the family of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the battle of al-Ahzab. Ahmad al-Abbasi said: Banu Mughalah: and they Banu Adi ibn Amr ibn Malik, and Mughalah their mother, west of the mosque at the side of Bab al-Rahmah and they have Fari' atm of Hassan ibn Thabit and Biruha'. I say: And these atam and historical landmarks all gone in a past time, and no trace remained of them indicating their locations except what the historians wrote in describing them and determining their places.","Translation":"This story talks about Atam Bani Mughalah and its location near the Prophet's Mosque. It had a prominent role during the Prophet's battles in Medina, peace be upon him."},{"Place":"A'la Makkah","City":"Makkah al-Mukarramah","Description":"A place in Makkah (al-Mu'alla). Al-Bukhari narrated with his chain from Abdullah ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came the day of the conquest from upper Makkah on his mount carrying behind him Usamah ibn Zayd and with him Bilal, and with him Uthman ibn Talhah from the doorkeepers until he knelt in the mosque. And narrated with his chain from Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) entered the year of the conquest from Kada' which at upper Makkah. And narrated with his chain - in the hadith of entering Makkah - from Hisham from his father the Prophet (peace be upon him) entered the year of the conquest from upper Makkah from Kada'. And narrated with his chain from Hisham from his father and ordered the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) to plant his banner at al-Hajun, Urwah said and Nafi' ibn Jubayr ibn Mut'im informed me he said: I heard al-Abbas saying to al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam O Abu Abdullah here the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) ordered you to plant the banner? He said: And the Messenger of Allah ordered that day Khalid ibn al-Walid to enter from upper Makkah from Kada' and the Prophet (peace be upon him) entered from Kuda. Ibn Hajar said his saying: And the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered that day Khalid ibn al-Walid to enter from upper Makkah from Kada', meaning with extension, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) entered from Kudi meaning with shortening, and this opposes the sound hadiths that Khalid entered from lower Makkah, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) from its upper, and likewise Ibn Ishaq affirmed that Khalid entered from lower and the Prophet (peace be upon him) entered from its upper, and a dome was pitched for him there, and Musa ibn Uqbah presented that a clear presentation so said: And the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) sent al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam on the Muhajirun and their horses, and ordered him to enter from Kada' from upper Makkah, and ordered him to stick his banner at al-Hajun and not move until he comes to him, and sent Khalid ibn al-Walid in tribes of Quda'ah and Sulaym and others, and ordered him to enter from lower Makkah and to stick his banner at the nearest houses, and sent Sa'd ibn Ubadah in the battalion of the Ansar in the forefront of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) . And Ibn Ishaq said and Ibn Abdullah ibn Abi Najih narrated to me in his hadith: That the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) ordered Khalid ibn al-Walid, so he entered from al-Layt lower Makkah in some people, and Khalid was on the right wing... and Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah came with the line of the Muslims advancing to Makkah in front of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) , and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) entered from Adha Khir, until he descended at upper Makkah and a dome was pitched for him there. And al-Waqidi narrated from Hizam ibn Hisham from his father who said: Al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam came with who with him from the Muslims until he ended with them at al-Hajun so he stuck the banner at the home of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) . And narrated with his chain from Abu Ja'far , he said: Abu Rafi' had pitched for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) a dome at al-Hajun from leather, so the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came until he ended at the dome, and with him Umm Salamah and Maymunah. And al-Waqidi said - in the news of the farewell pilgrimage - narrated to me Ibn Abi Sabrah, from Musa ibn Sa'd, from Ikrimah from Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) entered Makkah daytime from Kudi on his mount al-Qaswa to al-Abtah, until he entered from upper Makkah until he ended at the door called Bab Banu Shaybah. And narrated with his chain from Umm Hani', she said I said: O Messenger of Allah, will you not descend in the houses of Makkah? So he refused and camped at al-Abtah until he exited the day of tarwiyah, then returned from Mina so descended at al-Abtah until he exited to Madinah, and did not descend a house nor shaded. Al-Fakihi said: And the limit of al-Mu'alla in what is said - and Allah knows best - , and in what the report came with that the hadith of Jurhum, and Qatura , that they when descended Makkah after al-Amaliq, divided Makkah into two halves, so for Jurhum upper the valley, and for Qatur lower it, so the possession of Jurhum the face of the Ka'bah to the Black Corner and the Maqam and the place of Zamzam ascending right and left and Qu'ayqi'an to upper the valley. And the possession of Qatur al-Masfalah the back of the Ka'bah the Yemeni corner and the western and the two Ajyad and al-Thaniyyah and al-Masfalah. And Jurhum used to tax who came from al-Mu'alla, and Qatur used to tax who came from al-Masfalah. Al-Fasi said in his talk about the cemeteries of Makkah: The cemetery known as al-Mu'alla, and said: al-Ma'li with lam and ya', and it famous we narrated with the chain to al-Azraqi he said: And my grandfather informed me from al-Zanji he said: The people of Makkah in Jahiliyyah and in the beginning of Islam used to bury their dead in Shib Abi Dhi'b and between al-Hajun, to the small shib shib al-shabab, and in the shib shib adjacent to Thaniyyat al-Madaniyyin which is today the cemetery of the people of Makkah then the cemetery proceeds ascending adjacent to the mountain to Thaniyyah Adhakhar at the wall of Kharman... and the people of Makkah used to bury their dead on the two sides of the valley right and left in Jahiliyyah and Islam, then the people transferred all their graves to the left shib. Al-Fasi said: The wall of Kharman it is - and Allah knows best - the place called: al-Kharmaniyyah, and it is valleys at upper the place known as al-Ma'abidah outside Makkah and Thaniyyah Azakhir above this place, and it famous, and the cemetery ended to it in Jahiliyyah and from it the Prophet (peace be upon him) entered the day of the conquest of Makkah. And al-Azraqi narrated with his chain from Ata' that the Prophet (peace be upon him) after he resided in Madinah did not enter the houses of Makkah, he said: When he circumambulated the House he went to upper Makkah so camped at it al-Abniyah, Ata' said: In his hajj he did that also, and descended upper Makkah before the ihram, and the night of the departure descended upper the valley. Atiq al-Biladi said: Al-Mu'alla: it is the upper part of Makkah al-Mukarramah, and today applied to a neighborhood and market between al-Hajun and the Sacred Mosque, and mostly applied to the cemetery of Makkah which became known as al-Mu'alla for its location in this neighborhood. And al-Mu'alla also: upper Wadi Rahat, forms with al-Majma'ah and al-Bajurah, land of Rahat, and it for al-Rawqah from Ataybah, in it Ayn al-Nabi, said: That he (peace be upon him) arrived it. I say: From what preceded of the statements of the scholars in determining the location of upper Makkah al-Mu'alla( the reader clears the location of al-Mu'alla from Makkah, and since upper Makkah remains known by its name, and famous in the cemetery of Makkah (al-Mu'alla) so what I mentioned from the statements of the scholars suffices and Allah is the guider.","Translation":"This story talks about a place called \"the hamza with fatha, the ain mahmula sakinah, and the lam followed by a shortened alif,\" which is an area in Mecca where Al-Bukhari narrated with his chain that the Prophet, peace be upon him, entered Mecca on the day of the conquest from this place."},{"Place":"Awatas","City":"Between Makkah and al-Ta'if","Description":"A place located east of Makkah, in the lands of Hawazin. Al-Bukhari narrated with his chain from Abu Musa peace be upon him he said when the Prophet (peace be upon him) finished from Hunayn he sent Abu Amir on an army to Awatas so he met Durayd ibn al-Simmah so Durayd was killed and Allah defeated his companions. . . the hadith. Al-Bakri said: Awatas with fat-ha first, and with taa' and sin without dots valley in the lands of Hawazin and there they camped they and Thaqif when they agreed on war against the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), so they met at Hunayn and their leader Malik ibn Awf al-Nasri, , and Durayd ibn al-Simmah said to them and he in a litter led by his camel: In which valley are you? They said: In Awatas. He said: Yes the field of horses, not a rough hard, nor a soft sinking. And to Awatas they retreated for them after they were defeated, and some retreated to al-Ta'if. And Durayd was among those overtaken by the pursuit at Awatas so killed, killed by Rabi'ah ibn Rufay' al-Sulami. And Hunayn: water for them. A woman from the Muslims said when Allah defeated Hawazin and showed His messenger over them: Indeed Hunayn our water so leave it if you draw from it you will not ascend it this the Messenger of Allah we will not fail him. Yaqut said: Al-Awatas: may be transferred from plural of watis and it is the oven, like yamin and ayman, and said: al-Watis depression in stone ignited under it the fire so cooks in it the meat. And said: Watasta the thing watsa if crushed it and affected in it, and Awatas: valley in dar Hawazin in it was the battle of Hunayn for the Prophet (peace be upon him) , with Banu Hawazin, and that day the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: «The watis heated and that when the war intensified», and he (peace be upon him) first who said it, and Ibn Shabbib said: The ghor from Dhat Irq to Awatas, and Awatas on the road itself, and Najd from the limit of Awatas to al-Qaryatayn. And Abu al-Hasan Ahmad ibn Faris the linguist said in his Amali my father recited to me may Allah mercy him: O dar deserted at Awatas and others from after its inhabited the rains and the moors how much for your people from time and from years and where settled the dews and the tents reply the answer on Haran depressed his sleepless free and the sleep imprisoned so the ruins did not explain to us from news and the blindnesses the concealers cleared. And Abu Wajzah al-Sa'di said: O my two companions look do you see for us between al-Aqiq and Awatas at Ahdaj. And said Laghdah and at Awatas meet the road of Basra and the road of Kufa, and the people of al-Yamamah come from Nakhlah al-Yamaniyyah - meaning the roads of Hajj - and said: And the road of Basra and Kufa meet at Umm Kharman, and it is Awatas, and in Umm Kharman the poet says: O Umm Kharman raise the fuel for your fire has prolonged the extinguishing. And Yaqut said Umm Kharman with damma on kha' with dots, and quiescence ra', and mim and alif and nun, and narrated with zay also: name of a place. And Ibn al-Sikit related in the book al-Muthanna, Abu Mahdi said: Umm Kharman meeting of hajj of Basra and hajj of Kufa, and it a pond beside it a red hill on its head a fireplace, and recited: O Umm Kharman raise the fuel see men and tall camels prolonged your fire the extinguishing did you sleep or not find a stick? And al-Hudhali recited saying: O Umm Kharman raise the light of the flame for the suwayq and the flour have gone. And in the book of Nasr: Umm Kharman mountain on eight miles from al-Umrah which most hajj of Iraq assume ihram from it, and upon it a sign and a watchtower, and used to be ignited upon it for guiding the travelers, and at it Birka Awatas, and from it the people of Basra turn from the road of the people of Kufa - I say and that in their return from Makkah to their countries. And in the book al-Manasek: al-Harbi said: And on eight miles from Ghamrah at the eleventh of the post left, before the post Umm Kharman, and from it the people of Basra turn, and it the mountain upon which a sign and a watchtower, and at it Birka Awatas and wells and homes. . . and Awatas in it palaces and houses and shops and a pond, left. And in a rajaz mentioned by al-Harbi in describing the road of Hajj from Basra to Makkah: Until when passed by Umm Kharman and that when the two roads met they supplicated to Allah the Forgiving the Beneficent then proceeded like the locusts the arsal sajimah their eyes with tears they raised their voices with ihlal. I say: The statements of the scholars agree on determining the place of Awatas, and that it also called: Umm Kharman, but some researchers fell into mixing between it and Hunayn and made them one place , and said that the battle of Hunayn was in Awatas - Yaqut and others said that - and the fact that Awatas and Hunayn two different places, for the battle of Hunayn occurred in Wadi Hunayn as many of the people of reports agreed on that, as for the battle that occurred in Awatas it occurred between the army that the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent led by Abu Amir and between the remnants that were defeated in the battle of Hunayn and retreated to Awatas, and I have clarified the correct regarding this mixing between the two places in the entry (Hunayn) in this book. Hamad al-Jasir said commenting on one of the writers: Awatas and Hunayn two places between them tens of miles, one in Tihamah, and the second east of the mountains of Hijaz outside them. Hunayn is upper Wadi al-Shara'i', and its name Yada'an known now, but the people of that region replace the ya' with jim so say: (Jada'an), Nasr al-Iskandari said in his book - which remains manuscript - Yada'an valley in it a mosque for the Prophet (peace be upon him) , and in it Hawazin camped the day of Hunayn, in Wadi Nakhlah. And Yaqut transferred this and did not mention its source, and the saying that it in Wadi Nakhlah in it latitude, for it near Wadi Nakhlah al-Yamaniyyah located south of it, and not in it. As for Awatas the nearest inhabited places from it Ashirah, which was a station from the stations of the road of Hijaz from Najd, so became now a village . . . and Bajir ibn Zuhayr ibn Abi Salma said: Was the calamity the day of Batn Hunayn and the morning of Awatas and the day of al-Abrak so distinguished between the two places - and the battle one, started in Hunayn and it as came its description in the books of campaigns - valley from the valleys of Tihamah hollow lines descends in it descending, so the defeat fell on the Muslims at first, then they stood and won until they defeated their enemies, so some fled towards al-Ta'if, and some escaped to Awatas and some headed to Nakhlah, and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) sent for him in the traces of who headed before Awatas from the Muslims defeated who gathered there from the enemies. And where occurred from some historians what is understood from it considering them one place, with their difference, for Awatas located east of the chain of the mountains of Hijaz, the nearest inhabited places from it Ashirah, located west of Wadi al-Aqiq, near al-Birkah north of it towards the west the places that Hamad al-Jasir determined Awatas by remain known by their names: Wadi al-Aqiq, Ashirah, al-Birkah.","Translation":"This story talks about a place called \"Awatas\" east of Mecca in the lands of Hawazin. This place witnessed a battle between the Muslims and Hawazin after the Battle of Hunayn, where some forces retreated to Awatas. Historians differed in identifying it, with some thinking Hunayn is the same as Awatas, while others clarified that the two locations are different."},{"Place":"Al-Ahwaz","City":"Iran","Description":"Seven districts between Basra and Persia. Al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih from al-Azraq ibn Qays we were at al-Ahwaz fighting al-Haruriyyah so while I on the bank of a river behold a man praying and behold the bridle of his mount in his hand so the mount kept pulling him and he kept following it, Shu'bah said: He is Abu Barzah al-Aslami. Ibn Hajar said: Al-Ahwaz with fat-ha on hamza and quiescence of ha', it a known town between Basra and Persia, opened in the caliphate of Umar, said in al-Muhkam: It has no singular from its word, Abu Ubayd al-Bakri said: It a land gathers it seven districts so mentioned them. Ibn Khurdadhabih said: It vast lands connected to the mountain and Isfahan. Al-Qazwini said: Al-Ahwaz region between Basra and Persia and said to it Khuzistan in it buildings and waters and valleys many, and kinds of fruits and sugar and much rice, but in its summer does not leave the hell. Yaqut said: Al-Ahwaz: last zay, and it plural of hawz, and its origin huz, so when the Persians used this word much they changed it until removed its origin altogether; because there is no ha' without dots in the speech of the Persians, and if they spoke with a word with ha' they turned it ha' so said in Hasan Hasn, and in Muhammad Mahmad, then the Arabs picked it up so turned by the rule of abundance in usage and on this al-Ahwaz Arabic name named by it in Islam. And its name in the days of the Persians was Khuzistan, and in Khuzistan places said to each one Khuz such. From them: Khuz Banu Asad and others, so al-Ahwaz name for the district entirely. As for the town that this name prevails upon it among the common today only it Suq al-Ahwaz, and the origin of al-huz in the speech of the Arabs infinitive haz the man the thing yahuzu huzan if gathered it and owned it. Abu Mansur al-Azhari said: Al-huz in the lands that a man takes it and clarifies its boundaries so he deserves it so no one has right in it so that al-huz. And from al-Tawzi that he said: Al-Ahwaz called in Persian Her Mashir, and only its name was al-Akhwaz so the people Arabized it so said al-Ahwaz, and recited for a Bedouin: Do not return to al-Akhwaz again Qu'ayqi'an which in the side of the market and Nahr Bat which became troubling me in it the mosquitoes with sting without sympathy. And the owner of Kitab al-Ayn said al-Ahwaz seven districts between Basra and Persia, for each district a name and gathers them al-Ahwaz and the singular is not separated by hawz. And the districts of al-Ahwaz Suq al-Ahwaz, and Ram Hurmuz, and Idhaj, and Askar Mukram, and Tustar, and Jundaysabur, and Sus, and Saraq, and Nahr Tiri, and Manadhir, and its kharaj was thirty thousand thousand dirhams, and the Persians used to assess upon it fifty thousand thousand dirhams. I say: And after what preceded Yaqut elaborated in describing al-Ahwaz its climate and geography and natural environment, and characteristics of its people and their morals, and mentioned a number of those attributed to it from scholars and hadith narrators. And in al-Rawd al-Mi'tar: al-Himyari said: Al-Ahwaz city connected to the mountain, opened by Harqus ibn Zuhayr al-Sa'di, in the caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), and al-Ahwaz it Khuzistan and it Ram Hurmuz, and between al-Ahwaz and Isfahan forty-five parasangs, and al-Ahwaz place gathers seven districts. And al-Baladhuri talked about the opening of al-Ahwaz in the era of Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) so said: Abu Musa al-Ash'ari came when Umar ibn al-Khattab appointed him over Basra after al-Mughirah, so he employed Ziyad as scribe, and Umar ibn al-Khattab followed him with Umran ibn al-Husayn al-Khuza'i and made him over teaching the people jurisprudence and the Quran and deputy of Abu Musa if he absents from Basra so Abu Musa marched to al-Ahwaz, and continued opening rustaq after rustaq, and river after river, and the non-Arabs flee from before him, so he overcame all its land, except al-Sus and Tustar and Manadhir and Ram Hurmuz, then mentioned the opening of what remained of its land and its rustaqs in stages, until ended its opening all, and that was in the caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him). I say: And al-Ahwaz remains known by its name in this era, and it inside the Iranian borders.","Translation":"This story talks about Al-Ahwaz, seven districts between Basra and Persia, famous for its conquest during the caliphate of Umar bin Al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, by Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari."},{"Place":"Al-Aykah","City":"Madyan","Description":"Lands of Madyan people of Shu'ayb. Allah exalted said: (And indeed the companions of al-Aykah were wrongdoers) Surah al-Hijr verse 78, al-Bukhari said: Mujahid said: Laykah al-Aykah. Ibn Jarir said exalted says: And indeed the companions of the thicket were wrongdoers. Says: They were disbelievers in Allah, and al-Aykah the intertwined gathered trees, as Umayyah said: Like the cooing of the doves on the branches of al-Aykah in the branches the grieving. And narrated with his chain from Qatadah, and His saying: (And indeed the companions of al-Aykah were wrongdoers) mentioned to us that they were people of thicket. And their trees mostly this doum, and their messenger in what reached us Shu'ayb (peace be upon him) sent to them and to the people of Madyan, sent to two nations from the people and tormented with two different torments. As for the people of Madyan the cry seized them, and as for the companions of al-Aykah they were people of intertwined trees, mentioned to us that He inflicted upon them the heat seven days, no shade shades them from it nor anything prevents them from it so Allah sent upon them a cloud so they settled under it seeking relief in it so Allah made it upon them torment, sent upon them fire so blazed upon them so consumed them, so that the torment of the day of the shade it was torment of a great day. And narrated with his chain from Ibn Jurayj, His saying: (And indeed the companions of al-Aykah were wrongdoers). Said: People of Shu'ayb. Ibn Abbas said: Al-Aykah with thickets and trees they were in. Ibn Kathir said: And who claimed from the interpreters like Qatadah and others that the companions of al-Aykah another nation other than the people of Madyan so his saying weak, and only their evidence two things: one that He said:(The companions of al-Aykah denied the messengers (176) When Shu'ayb said to them Will you not fear (177)) Surah al-Shu'ara' verse 176 - 17, and did not say their brother as He said: (Andto Madyan their brother Shu'ayb) and mentioned in and the second that He mentioned their torment with the day of the shade, those the earthquake or the cry. And the answer to the first: That He did not mention the brotherhood after His saying: (The companions of al-Aykah denied the messengers) because He described them with worship of al-Aykah, so mentioning the brotherhood does not suit here. And when He attributed them to the tribe it was suitable to mention Shu'ayb that he their brother. And this difference from the precious subtle rare noble. As for their argument with the day of the shade, if it was evidence by itself that these another nation, so let the numbering of the revenge with the earthquake and the cry be evidence that they two other nations, and this no one who understands anything from this matter says. As for the hadith that al-Hafiz ibn Asakir presented in the biography of the prophet Shu'ayb peace be upon him with his chain from Abdullah ibn Amr raised: (That the people of Madyan and the companions of al-Aykah two nations Allah sent to them Shu'ayb the prophet peace be upon him) . So it a strange hadith and in its men who was spoken about. And the most likely that it from the speech of Abdullah ibn Amr, from what he found the day of Yarmuk from those two loads from the news of Banu Isra'il.. and Allah knows best. Then Allah mentioned about the people of al-Aykah from the blame what He mentioned about the people of Madyan from the shortchanging in the measure and the scale, so indicated that they one nation, and destroyed with kinds from the torment. And mentioned in each place what suits it from the address. Al-Qurtubi said: (And indeed the companions of al-Aykah were wrongdoers)Intends people of Shu'ayb they were owners of groves and gardens and fruit trees, and al-Aykah: the thicket, and it the group of trees, and the plural al-ayk, and narrated that their trees were doum and it al-Miql, al-Nabighah said: Polish with my forelock a dove of al-Aykah hail lowered its gums with the antimony. And said: Al-Aykah name of the village, and said name of the town, and Abu Ubaydah said al-Aykah and Laykah their city. Al-Bakri said: Al-Aykah mentioned in the book of Allah exalted, were the homes of people of Shu'ayb: narrated from Ibn Abbas in it two narrations: one that al-Aykah Madyan to Shaghab and Bada, and the second that it from the seacoast to Madyan. Said: And their trees al-Miql and al-Aykah with the people of language the intertwined trees and they were owners of intertwined trees. And some said al-Aykah the thicket, and Laykah: name of the town around it, as said in Makkah and Bakkah, Abu Ja'far ibn al-Nahhas said: Not known (Laykah) name of a town. Yaqut said: Al-Aykah which came its mention in the book of Allah exalted: (The companions of al-Aykah denied the messengers), said: It is Tabuk which the Prophet (peace be upon him) campaigned to it last of his campaigns, and the people of Tabuk say that and know it and say: That Shu'ayb peace be upon him sent to the people of Tabuk, and I did not find this in the books of interpretation, rather they say al-Aykah the intertwined thicket of trees, and the plural ayk, and that the intended by the companions of al-Aykah the people of Madyan, Yaqut said: And Madyan and Tabuk adjacent. I say: This summary of what the interpreters and historians mentioned in defining al-Aykah mentioned in the book of Allah exalted, and from what preceded we see difference between the interpreters in defining the companions of al-Aykah, so some see that the companions of al-Aykah and Madyan one nation, and some see that they two nations sent to them Shu'ayb, although Ibn Kathir prefers that they one nation, and denied on who said: They two different nations, and Allah knows best. And in the entry (Madyan) more clarification.","Translation":"This story talks about the people of Midian and the Companions of Al-Aykah, whom God described as oppressors due to shortchanging in measures and weights. The Prophet Shu'aib was sent to these two nations, and they were punished differently; the people of Midian with the shout and the Companions of Al-Aykah with severe heat and fire. Interpreters differ on whether they were one nation or two different nations."},{"Place":"Ayla","City":"Jordan","Description":"A city on the coast of the head of the Gulf of Aqaba. Al-Bukhari narrated from Yunus that Raziq ibn al-Hakim wrote to Ibn Shihab while I was with him at Wadi al-Qura: Do you think I should combine? And Raziq was a worker on land he cultivated with a group of Sudanese and others, and Raziq was then in charge of Ayla. Ibn Hajar said: Ayla with fathah on the hamzah and sukun on the ya' below, followed by lam, a well-known town on the road to Sham between Medina and Egypt, on the coast of the Red Sea. Raziq was its governor on behalf of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz. It appears that the land he farmed was part of Ayla's domain, and he did not ask about Ayla itself because it was a large city with a fortress, now in ruins, visited by Egyptian and Ghazzan pilgrims, with some traces visible. Yaqut said: Ayla with fathah, a city on the coast of the Red Sea toward Sham, said to be the end of Hijaz and beginning of Sham. Abu Zayd: A small inhabited city with little cultivation, the city of the Jews whom Allah forbade fishing on Sabbath, but they disobeyed and were transformed into apes and pigs. They have the Prophet's covenant. Abu al-Mundhir: Named after Ayla bint Madin ibn Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Abu Ubaydah: A city between Fustat and Mecca on the Red Sea coast, part of Sham. Yuhanna ibn Ru'bah came to the Prophet from Ayla at Tabuk, made peace for jizyah of one dinar per adult annually, totaling 300 dinars, and hospitality for passing Muslims, with protection. Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz did not increase beyond 300 dinars. Ahiha ibn al-Julah lamented his son: Indeed my eye sheds tears in grief, patient yet sorrowful. If sadness strikes by day, my night is longer and more bitter. What use are Ayla's dinars in slanderers' hands, bright yet consumed? Better than him on the day he departed, death hastened him. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Muhallabi described the Hajj route from Fustat to Ayla: From Fustat to Jubb Umayrah six miles, then to Ajrud with a salty well far to draw, forty miles, then to Qulzum thirty-five miles, then to Thajr water two days, then to Kursi well with fresh water one stage, then to head of Ayla's pass one stage, then to Ayla city one stage. Ayla is grand on a salty sea tongue, gathering Fustat and Sham pilgrims. People claim descent from Uthman ibn Affan's clients, said to have the Prophet's cloak gifted to Yuhanna at Tabuk. Ayla's tribute about 3000 dinars. Attributed to Ayla are narrators like Yunus ibn Yazid al-Ayli, died in Upper Egypt 252 AH; Ishaq ibn Ismail al-Ayli, narrated from Sufyan ibn Uyaynah, died in Ayla 258 AH; Hassan ibn Aban al-Ayli, judge of Damietta, died 322 AH. In al-Rawd al-Mu'tar, al-Himyari: Ayla on Mecca road from Egypt, first Hijaz border, grand city on salty sea, gathering Egyptian and Moroccan pilgrims, much trade, mixed people. Named after Ayla bint Madin. Said to be the seaside village in Quran. Ibn Ishaq: At Tabuk, Yuhanna ibn Ru'bah made peace, gave jizyah, Prophet wrote security. Abu Hamid al-Sa'idi: Ayla's owner gifted white mule, cloak, wrote for them. From Ayla ascend steep pass not climbed mounted, full day long, then two stages in Tih wilderness. Ayla border of ancient Roman kingdom... From Ayla to Jerusalem six stages... Inhabited by Banu Umayyah, mostly Uthman's clients, Hajj water providers, much knowledge, manners, trade, markets, palms, crops. Fa'iq, Khumarawayh's freedman, repaired Ayla's pass. Ayla has markets, mosques, many Jews claiming Prophet's cloak as pledge, showing Adeni robe wrapped, exposing a span. Sultan al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghuri repaired it last among Circassian kings before 720 AH. Imam al-Harbi described coastal Hajj route from Ayla to Medina: From Ayla to Aynuna, Musalla, Nabk, Dhaba, Marrah, Uwaynid, Wajh... completing to Medina. Ibn Hisham: At Tabuk, Yuhanna ibn Ru'bah of Ayla made peace, gave jizyah; Jarba' and Adhruh gave jizyah, Prophet wrote for them. Baladhuri: Prophet went to Tabuk against Romans and allies in year 9 AH, stayed days, made peace with locals on jizyah. Yuhanna of Ayla made peace for one dinar per adult, 300 dinars, hospitality, protection. Hamd al-Jasir: Distance between Haql and Aqaba 25 km, unpaved road along shore where mountains near, low height. Aqaba developed in port and buildings, but settlement desire weak, despite government care in roads and facilities. Aqaba known anciently as Ayla, mentioned in Tafsir and Torah. Prophet made peace with its people on jizyah after Tabuk. Early Islam, populated by Banu Umayyah, Uthman's clients and kin. Saladin besieged its fortress, captured 566 AH. Famous as Egyptian Hajj station, mentioned in travel books. Remaining castle from 8th Hijri century. In Islamic Dictionary: Ayla small port at Gulf of Aqaba head, Aramaic Elon, Hebrew Elath. Ancient trade center between Egypt, Palestine, Arabia. Entered Roman domain, Muslims took peacefully from Yuhanna ibn Ru'bah year 8 AH (630 CE) after Tabuk. Flourished in Islamic era, Ahmad ibn Tulun built fortified road called Ayla Pass, then place called Aqaba metaphorically, now Arab port in Jordan. Muslims and Crusaders contested Ayla strategically until Saladin annexed finally 567 AH (1171 CE). Also Ayla place in Radwa, Yaqut: mountain. Ibn Habib: Ayla from Radwa, mountain between Mecca and Medina, not the city, as wild animals not attributed to cities. Kathir: Saw with companions at Ayla exhausted, Pleiades star sunk. For Uzza fire lit, not dimming like star when eyed from afar. Companions marveled at it kindled, more for warmer at night's end. If dims at end, rekindled with flint ignites. Also Kathir: If offered mother of child's talk, protect in Radwa approaching. Descend from Das and Ayla edges to her, even if dogs incited. Bakri: Ayla ravine from Radwa, Yambu mountain, quoted Kathir's verses.","Translation":"This story talks about the city of Ayla, a town on the coast of the Gulf of Aqaba. In the past, it was an important commercial center between Egypt, Palestine, and the Arabian Peninsula, and it came under Muslim control after the Tabuk expedition in the eighth year of Hijra. It was famous for its importance as a Hajj route and its ancient history, mentioned in the Torah and Islamic interpretation books. Muslims and Crusaders disputed it until Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi annexed it permanently in 567 AH (1171 AD)."},{"Place":"Ilya","City":"Palestine","Description":"City of Jerusalem.

Ibn Hajar: Iliya' with hamzah maksurah, ya' sakinah, lam maksurah, ya' akhirah, alif mahmuz, Bakri reported shortening. Also Ilya without first ya', sukun on lam per Bakri, Nawawi similar but ya' before lam, strange. Meaning: House of God. Yaqut: Iliya' kasrah on first and lam, ya' and mamdudah alif, Jerusalem's name, meaning House of God. Hafsi reported shortening. Third dialect omits first ya': Ilya sukun lam and extension. Abu Ali: Jerusalem called Iliya' per Farazdaq: Two houses, God's House we guard, and palace atop Iliya' lofty. Said named after builder Iliya' ibn Iram ibn Sam ibn Nuh (peace).

Thus vocalized fathah first, sukun second, light dal kasrah: Purified house cleansing sins. Marwan: Tell Farazdaq, folly his name, if leaving command, sit.

Jerusalem people asked Abu Ubaydah security, peace like Sham cities, jizyah, kharaj, entering like peers, but contract by Umar himself. Abu Ubaydah wrote Umar, who came, stayed Jabiyah from Damascus, then Jerusalem, effected peace, wrote them year 17 AH. Yaqut from Ka'b: Don't call Jerusalem Iliya', call by name, Iliya' woman built city. Baladhuri on Iliya' conquest: Abu Ubaydah after Qinnasrin year 16 AH joined Amr besieging Iliya', Jerusalem. Said sent to Antioch for breach, conquered, returned. Iliya' people asked Abu Ubaydah security, peace like Sham, jizyah, kharaj, like peers, contract by Umar.

Went till reached Bir Ma'unah, betrayed, killed. Invoked month against Ra'l, Dhakwan, Banu Lihyan. Yaqut: Bir Ma'unah nun, Ibn Ishaq: Bir Ma'unah between Banu Amir and Banu Sulaym lava, both lands near but closer Sulaym lava. Said: Bir Ma'unah in mountains called Abala on ascending road from Medina to Mecca, for Banu Sulaym per Aram. Abu Ubaydah in Battles: Water for Banu Amir ibn Sa'sa'ah.

It is mentioned in the Quran in Surah Al-Fath, verse 24: \"And He is the One who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Makkah.\" This verse refers to the events of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, when the disbelievers attempted to ambush the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) and his companions, but Allah protected them. According to a narration in Sahih al-Bukhari, Uthman ibn Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) was sent by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to negotiate with Quraysh. During his absence, the Prophet took the pledge of allegiance on Uthman’s behalf by placing his own hand over his other hand. Other narrations describe how thirty armed men, and in another account eighty men from Makkah, came down from Mount Taneem trying to attack the Muslims, but the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) supplicated against them and Allah took away their sight, allowing the Muslims to capture and release them. Scholars like Al-Fakihi and Yaqut described Batn Makkah as the area between the white mountain pass leading to Taneem and the pass of Al-Hashhas, which includes neighborhoods like Al-Zahraa and Al-Shuhadaa today.","Translation":"This story talks about the events that occurred in the Hudaybiyah expedition, where the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, mentioned the companions' feats and God's support for them, and referred to the story of Uthman bin Affan, may God be pleased with him, fleeing in the Battle of Uhud, his absence from Badr and the pledge.

Batn Al-Wadi is on the side of Jamrat Al-Aqabah and is known to Muslims."},{"Place":"Baath ","City":"Al-Madinah al-Munawwarah","Description":"A location near the tribe of Qurayzah in Medina. Al-Bukhari reported from Aisha that the Day of Baath was a day that God brought forth in advance for His Messenger, as the Prophet arrived in Medina after their leaders had already been killed or wounded and their unity shattered, which prepared their hearts for entering Islam. Ibn Hajar stated that Baath is correctly pronounced with a \"b\" and soft \"a\" and ends in \"th.\" Some narrators mistakenly recorded it with a \"gh\" sound, attributing the error to one of the narrators from the scholar Al-Khalil. Others such as Al-Azhari noted the mistake was from the narrator of Al-Khalil, and some sources recorded both versions of the name. The place is described as either a fortress or a farm near the Qurayzah tribe about two miles from Medina. It was the site of a fierce battle between the Aws and Khazraj tribes before Islam, where many were killed. The leader of the Aws was Hudayr, father of Usayd ibn Hudayr, who was called the Commander of the Battalions, and he was killed there. The Khazraj leader that day was Amr ibn al-Nu'man, who was also killed. Although the Khazraj initially had the upper hand, Hudayr rallied the Aws, who then emerged victorious, though Hudayr later died of his wounds. This battle occurred five years before the Prophet’s migration to Medina, though some reports say four or more, with the first being the most accurate. Yaqut affirmed the location and noted that some authors had mistakenly transcribed the name with a \"gh\" sound, though this was deemed incorrect by major scholars. Others described Baath as a place or fortress on the lands of Qurayzah, specifically a farm called Qura, while others referred to it as a region near the Qurayzah lands. It was said to be two days’ journey from Medina, but stronger evidence shows it was much closer, based on accounts like that of Muhammad ibn Maslamah, who mentioned passing Qurayzah and Baath during the mission to kill Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf, indicating its proximity. Some poetry from the pre-Islamic period memorializes Baath as a major battlefield and associates it with surrounding landmarks, including Sila, a mountain near Medina. Other verses describe Baath as a place where livestock caravans once passed, and another poet swore never to forget Iraq even if he passed landmarks like Sila or Baath. The scholar Al-Bakri confirmed the location and its historical significance as the site of the famous conflict. Later historians like Al-Samhudi and Al-Zarkashi collected all related accounts, confirming that Baath was a location near the Qurayzah tribe, possibly a fortress or farmland, which included a garden called Qura. Some sources considered it among the assets of the Qurayzah tribe, and scholars disagreed about the precise details of the name, but all agreed on its geographical context. The poem by Qays ibn al-Khatim highlights Baath as the site of tribal defeat, while another by Khafaf laments the loss of Hudayr, referencing Baath. Another poem associates Baath with gardens and structures in nearby areas, and it is said to be near a wall called Maythab, south of an area called Al-Dilal, which included palm trees named Qawran — likely the same as Qura — reinforcing the association. Historical records from Ibn Ishaq mention that the Prophet’s companions passed through Baath when returning from the mission against Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf, indicating that Baath lies between Qurayzah and Al-Areez volcanic area. This refutes the claim that Baath was two days from Medina. The scholar Ahmad ibn Abdulhamid al-Abbasi stated that the Qurayzah and their allies had settled in the elevated area of Medina along the valleys of Madhanib and Mahzur. The tribe of al-Nadir settled along Madhanib, where they built farms, dug wells, and remained until they were expelled by the Prophet. Scholar Abdul Quddus al-Ansari, in mapping the valley origins, noted that the Madhanib valley came from the east of Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf’s fortress, curving around it and flowing past various landmarks until it merged with the Bathan valley. Ruins of that fortress still remain. As for the Mahzur valley, it originates from the eastern volcanic field and flows through different routes until it joins Madhanib. This region — the eastern volcanic area — was mentioned in ancient Jewish texts as the prophesied destination of the final prophet, which is why the Jewish tribes of Qaynuqa, Nadir, and Qurayzah settled there. Their homes were built in the center of this volcanic region, chosen for its natural defensive structure due to their frequent involvement in conflict and need for fortified housing. Today, this eastern volcanic zone has transformed into a flourishing area with villas, gardens, paved roads, public squares, government buildings, schools, hospitals, restaurants, shops, gas stations, and wedding halls — all a reflection of the peace and prosperity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Based on all of this, it becomes clear that the site of Baath — where the battle between Aws and Khazraj occurred — is located near the former homes of the Qurayzah tribe, within the eastern volcanic region and along the Mahzur valley.","Translation":"The story talks about Ba'ath, a place in Bani Qurayzah in Medina. It was the site of battles between Aws and Khazraj before the Hijra, and the Battle of Ba'ath occurred there, contributing to their entry into Islam later."},{"Place":"Al-Baqi","City":"Al-Madinah al-Munawwarah","Description":"Place in Medina, cemetery Medina people.

Al-Bukhari narrated from Ali (may God be pleased with him) that we were in a funeral in Baqi' al-Gharqad when the Prophet (peace be upon him) came to us, sat down, and we sat around him. He had a stick with him, lowered his head, and began to poke with his stick, then said: There is none of you, no breathing soul, but its place in Paradise or Hell has been written, and it has been written whether it is wretched or blessed. Yaqut said: Al-Gharqad with a dotted ghayn, and the origin of Baqi' in the language is the place with tree roots of various kinds, and it was named Baqi' al-Gharqad accordingly. Al-Gharqad is large Uwsaj (a type of thorny tree). The Rajiz said: They found a soft Sidr and Gharqad. Al-Khatim al-Akli said: Or graze in a fertile land depression and valleys growing Sidr and Gharqad. It is the cemetery of the people of Medina, inside the city... Al-Zubayr said: The upper valleys of al-Aqiq are al-Baqi', and he recited for Abu Qutayfah: Would that I knew where my wish is, the upper covenant Yalban Fabram, or as I knew al-Aqiq, or did the events and days change it after me. I said: His statement from al-Zubayr that the upper valleys of al-Aqiq are al-Baqi' mixes between al-Baqi' with a unified ba' and al-Naqi' with a unified nun, and it is known that al-Baqi' is the cemetery of the people of Medina inside the city, and al-Naqi' with a nun is a place outside the city that the Prophet (peace be upon him) protected for his horses, and this confusion has occurred to more than one historian due to the similarity of the names, and the discussion of al-Naqi' with a nun will come in detail in its entry, God willing. Al-Bakri said: Al-Baqi': with an open first, closed second, and undotted 'ayn: it is Baqi' al-Gharqad, the cemetery of Medina. Al-Asma'i said: Gharqad trees were cut in this place when Uthman was buried there, so it was named Baqi' al-Gharqad for that. Al-Khalil said: Al-Baqi' of the land is a place with tree roots, and it was named Baqi' al-Gharqad for the tree that grew there. In al-Maghanim al-Mutabah, al-Majd said: The origin of al-Baqi' in the language: every place with tree roots of various kinds, and it was named Baqi' al-Gharqad accordingly, and al-Gharqad is large Uwsaj. It is the cemetery of the people of Medina, was inside the city, and today outside the wall. Amr bin al-Nu'man al-Bayadi elegized his people, who entered a garden in one of their wars, closed its door, and fought until some killed others: The homes are empty, desolate without leaders, and from the hardships, my loneliness in leadership. Where are those I knew in bliss between al-Aqiq to Baqi' al-Gharqad? They had the awe of every tribe and weapons for every sharp seeker. Souls redeemed for youths from Amir, they drank death in a dire position. People who aimed to shed the blood of their nobles, some by others, the act of the misguided. O men, for a stumble of their time that left their homes as if never known. Al-Himyari attributed it to a man from Khatham. Al-Zubayr bin Bakkar said: The upper valleys of al-Aqiq: al-Baqi', as Yaqut said in the ba' entry, and it is an error, the correct is al-Naqi': with nun, distorted by Yaqut, and what al-Zubayr mentioned is with nun, and he recited for Abu Qutayfah Amr bin al-Walid, whom Abdullah bin al-Zubayr exiled from Medina among those exiled from Banu Umayyah, so he went to the Levant, saying longing for Medina: Would that I knew where my wish is, the upper covenant Yalban Fabram, or as I knew al-Baqi', or did the events and days change it after me? A home I desired to see, no access for one in Homs. A neighborhood between al-Arid and Sal', where Islam anchored its pillar. Closer to me in neighborhood than Christians in their homes with idols. They strike the bell at every dawn in lands frequented by ailments. And I exchanged my people for Akka and Lakhm and Juzam, and where is Juzam from me? And I exchanged my people's homes and the palaces with fortresses. Every lofty palace with pillars, pigeons singing on its tops. Flee from me the greeting if I come to my people, and few have peace with them. I cut the whole night in depression and sighing, hardly sleeping. Toward my people when the home separated us, and dreams deviated from their intent. Fearing the era's harm befalls them, and war that grays the youth. And it is time for this distance from us to be separation and departure. When Abdullah bin al-Zubayr heard his poetry, he said: Abu Qutayfah longed, whoever sees him, inform him I have secured him, so return, but he died before reaching Medina. Thus, al-Fayruzabadi corrected what Yaqut erred in distorting from al-Zubayr bin Bakkar, and in Abu Qutayfah's poetry Amr bin al-Walid. Al-Samhudi spoke of Baqi' al-Gharqad, saying: Baqi' al-Gharqad - it is large Uwsaj, was growing in al-Baqi', the cemetery of the people of Medina, cut when it was made a cemetery. Al-Baqi': every place with tree roots of various kinds. Then he cited five verses from Amr bin al-Nu'man al-Bayadi's poetry, without adding more. He had spoken at length about the virtue of al-Baqi' and the graves of the companions and the Prophet's family and the known shrines in Medina. Abd al-Quddus al-Ansari spoke of al-Baqi' and said in his account: Al-Baqi' is the only cemetery of the people of Medina from the era of the message to today, nearly ten thousand companions and female companions are buried there, and the Mothers of the Believers and the Prophet's sons (peace be upon him) and daughters, and among the great companions buried there: the third caliph Uthman bin Affan (may God be pleased with him), and among the followers Nafi', the teacher of Imam Malik bin Anas, and among the followers of the followers: Malik bin Anas and others. Al-Baqi' is a rectangular plot east of the city outside its wall, near Bab al-Jum'ah, length 150 meters by width 100 meters, walled on all sides, and on its door an inscription indicating this walling is from the Ottoman state's relics. The wall of al-Baqi' was restored during the Saudi state era, and adjacent to it from the north, attached land belonging to Uthman bin Affan's endowment for the Moroccans, taken by the expansion project office to remain an open space, and the endowments administration surrounded it with an iron fence to protect it... Directly after it to the north is a large land that was owned by the sharifs, purchased from them by Mr. Abdul Haq Naqshbandi, then taken from him with financial compensation and registered as an endowment for the interests of the Prophet's Mosque, remaining an open space. It had high chronic piles of the town's waste, the accumulated waste was removed, thus increasing al-Baqi's area much from previous eras. Al-Shanqiti said: Al-Baqi', this word has become a flag by predominance on the cemetery of Medina, east of the Prophet's Mosque, separated by a large neighborhood called in our era (Harat al-Aghawat) who are the Haram's servants, most of this neighborhood endowments, removed for the expansion of the Prophet's Haram and its squares, and with its removal, nothing separates the Haram from al-Baqi', in 1405 AH, and the passer in Abu Dhar Street sees the Prophet's Haram in utmost beauty, nothing mars his view from those ancient buildings. I said: From what preceded, we extract the most important matters mentioned: First: knowing the geographical environment of this spot, why named Baqi' al-Gharqad, and its location from the city. Second: Baqi' al-Gharqad was named thus since it was made a cemetery in the Prophet's era (peace be upon him). Third: Baqi' al-Gharqad is the cemetery of the people of Medina since the Prophet's era (peace be upon him) and remains to this era. Fourth: It contains a large number of companions' graves (may God be pleased with them) and followers and graves of the Prophet's wives (peace be upon him) and his children and daughters. Fifth: Knowing the large expansion added to its area during the current Saudi state era. Sixth: Establishing an administration to organize burial in it and supervise it.","Translation":"This story talks about Baqi' Al-Gharqad, the cemetery of Medina's people. It was named after the gharqad trees that grew there, cut when the cemetery was established. Baqi' contains graves of many companions, followers, the Prophet's wives, peace be upon him, his sons and daughters. Since the Prophet's time, peace be upon him, it has been Medina's cemetery to this day, witnessing major expansion in the Saudi era with organized burial management."},{"Place":"Baldah","City":"Makkah Al-Mukarramah","Description":"A valley in western Mecca. Al-Bukhari narrated from Abdullah bin Umar (may God be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) met Zayd bin Amr bin Nufayl at the bottom of Baldah before revelation descended on the Prophet (peace be upon him). A meal was presented to the Prophet (peace be upon him), but he refused to eat from it. Then Zayd said: I do not eat what you slaughter on your idols, and I only eat what God's name is mentioned on. Ibn Hajar said: Baldah is a place on the Tan'im road, with an open unified ba' and undotted ha' between them a silent lam, ending with undotted ha', and it is said: it is a valley. Al-Bakri said: Baldah with an open first, undotted dal and ha': a valley near al-Jirahiyah on the Tan'im road to Mecca. Yaqut said: Baldah ending with undotted ha', and dal before it, as Baldah the man when he strikes himself on the ground, sometimes they say Baltah, and Baldah the man when tired or promises without fulfilling. Baldah a valley before Mecca from the west, Ibn Qays al-Ruqayyat said: So Manifa al-Jamar from Abd Shams barren, then Baldah then Hara'. Al-Azraqi said: Fakh the valley at the base of the white pass to Baldah the valley you tread on the Jeddah road left of Dhi Tuwa. Its investigator said: Baldah a wide long valley, starts from the end of al-Shuhada neighborhood and ends at al-Hudaybiyah (al-Shumaysi), its most famous gardens still standing today in Umm al-Dud Umm al-Jud today, and Qazzaz garden, and Umm al-Dud garden. Al-Fakihi said: And in Baldah the poet says: And at the bend of the Sarh in Baldah's belly to Bir Bakar barren with Basis. Another said: How lovely Baldah's water and its dweller in it. Al-Fakihi said: Fakh and Bayut Siraj and al-Barud and Baldah, all close to each other, called Batn Mecca. The poet said: To the slope from Mifda al-Barud and Baldah to Wadi al-Hashhas when stumbling. Its investigator said: At the meeting of al-Shami Adakhir with Shib Banu Abdullah, the valley is called Fakh until reaching the white pass, then after the white pass called Baldah, today called al-Zahir, when passing al-Zahir called Umm al-Dud, accordingly: Fakh you tread going to Medina, Baldah you tread going to Jeddah. I said: Al-Waqidi mentioned that Quraysh when they went out to prevent the Prophet (peace be upon him) from Mecca in Umrah al-Hudaybiyah, stationed in Baldah, and sent Khalid bin al-Walid in the cavalry, placed scouts on the mountains until reaching a mountain called Wazar and Ragh, their scouts ten men led by al-Hakam bin Abd Manaf, signaling each other softly: Muhammad did such and such, until reaching Quraysh in Baldah. Quraysh went out to Baldah, pitched tents and pavilions, went out with women and children, camped there. Uthman bin Affan when the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent him to Quraysh from al-Hudaybiyah came to them in Baldah, said: Uthman went until reaching Baldah, found Quraysh there, they said: Where do you intend? He said: The Messenger of God sent me to you, said: Some met in Baldah and some in Mecca. I said: From what al-Waqidi and others mentioned, it appears Baldah a valley near al-Hudaybiyah facing it, between it and Mecca, al-Hudaybiyah the place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) and companions camped, now a village known as (al-Shumaysi). Baldah also: Al-Bakri said: Baldah a place in Banu Fazarah lands, in Baldah the proverb: But on Baldah people rough, said by Bayhas bin Suhayb al-Fazari when his brothers were killed and he captured, mentioned his capture the abundance of what they gained, meaning his family.","Translation":"This story talks about Wadi Baldah in western Mecca. Islamic history mentions that the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, met Zaid bin Amr bin Nufayl in this valley before revelation, and the Prophet refused to eat food sacrificed to idols. Wadi Baldah is historically important, witnessing key events in the Prophetic biography and Quraysh battles. It is now called Al-Shamisi, part of Batn Mecca with known walls to this day. It was also a subject in Arab poetry and proverbs."},{"Place":"Al-Buwayrah","City":"Al-Madinah al-Munawwarah","Description":"Place of Banu al-Nadir homes in Medina. Al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih from Nafi' from Abdullah (may God be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he burned Banu al-Nadir's palms and cut them, and it is al-Buwayrah: for it Hassan said: It was easy for the nobles of Banu Lu'ay a fire in al-Buwayrah blazing. Ibn Hajar said: Al-Buwayrah with dammah on the unified ba' diminutive, a known place. Yaqut said: Al-Buwayrah: diminutive of the well from which water is drawn, and al-Buwayrah is the place of Banu al-Nadir the Jews' homes whom the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) raided after Uhud by six months, burned their palms and cut their crops and trees. In it descended His saying: (Whatever you cut of date palms or left standing on their roots, it was by permission of God and to disgrace the defiantly disobedient) Surah al-Hashr: 5. Abu Sufyan bin al-Harith bin Abd al-Muttalib said: It grieves the nobles of Banu Lu'ay a fire in al-Buwayrah blazing. Hassan bin Thabit replied: May God sustain that fire and kindle in its groups the blaze. They were given the Book but wasted it and are blind to the Torah foolish. Jumal bin Jawwal al-Taghlibi said: And al-Buwayrah became desolate from Salam and Sa'd and Ibn Akhtab so it is barren. Yaqut also said: Al-Nadir name of a Jewish tribe in Medina, they and Qurayzah settled outside Medina in gardens and fortresses, the raid on Banu al-Nadir I did not see any Sira people mention their homes' names, needed by the viewer of this book, I searched and found their homes raided by the Prophet (peace be upon him) called Wadi Bathan... and a place called al-Buwayrah. In al-Maghanim al-Mutabah: Al-Majd cited what Yaqut mentioned in the Nadir raid and determining their homes, without adding. Al-Bakri said: Al-Buwayrah with dammah first, undotted ra' on the diminutive form, Fa'ila... and it is from Tayma'. Then mentioned the Prophet's raid (peace be upon him) on Banu al-Nadir, will clarify later. Al-Samhudi said: Buwayrah - diminutive of the well from which drawn - and in the Sahih burning Nadir palms and it is al-Buwayrah. Al-Majd said: Al-Buwayrah place of Banu al-Nadir homes and mentioned by al-Marjani. Ibn Sayyid al-Nas said in his saying: A fire in al-Buwayrah blazing narrated as al-Buwaylah and Ibn Sa'd mentioned the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) gave al-Zubayr bin al-Awwam and Abu Salama al-Buwaylah from Banu al-Nadir land. Al-Samhudi distinguished at length between al-Buwayrah homes of Banu al-Nadir raided by the Prophet, and al-Buwaylah with lam a fortress of theirs given by the Prophet (peace be upon him) to al-Zubayr bin al-Awwam and Abu Salama. I said: From scholars' preceding sayings clear without dispute that al-Buwayrah with undotted ra' is Banu al-Nadir homes raided by the Prophet (peace be upon him), burned their palms and cut their trees and expelled them. As for al-Buwaylah with lam, a fortress of theirs. Al-Waqidi said speaking of Banu al-Nadir properties God bestowed on His Messenger (peace be upon him) and what he gave some companions: Gave al-Zubayr bin al-Awwam and Abu Salama bin Abd al-Asad al-Buwaylah. Al-Samhudi mentioned al-Buwaylah a fortress of Jewish fortresses, quoting Ibn Zabalah. As for what Yaqut said in determining Banu al-Nadir homes: Wadi Bathan and a place called al-Buwayrah, no dispute between his saying Wadi Bathan and al-Buwayrah, as will come. As for Al-Bakri's saying determining al-Buwayrah from Tayma', al-Buwayrah he mentioned in Tayma' other than al-Buwayrah Banu al-Nadir homes in Medina: as understood from historians' sayings. Ibn Zabalah said: All of them - meaning the Jews - in Zahrah with properties in al-Safilah - Zahrah soft land between the lava and al-Safilah facing al-Quff - most settled in a place called Yathrib at the confluence of floods facing Zughabah. From Muhammad bin Ka'b al-Qurazi: Banu Qurayzah and brothers Banu Hadl and al-Nadir left, settled in al-Aliyah on two valleys called Mudhaynib and Mahzur, Banu al-Nadir on Mudhaynib made properties, first to dig wells in al-Aliyah and plant properties... made properties and built fortresses and homes. Ibn Shabbah said: Mahzur flood takes from the eastern lava and from Hakr lava Safah until Banu Qurayzah halt, then a ravine flows in it, takes on Banu Umayyah bin Zayd between homes in a valley called Mudhaynib, then it and Banu Qurayzah flood meet at al-Masharif - Banu Khatmah space - then the two valleys Mahzur and Mudhaynib join, separate in properties and enter all the Prophet's charities (peace be upon him) except Umm Ibrahim's Mashrabah, then to the two walls on Marwan bin al-Hakam's palace then the valley belly on Banu Yusuf palace, then in al-Baqi' until Banu Judaylah, the mosque in Mahzur belly, its end Abu al-Hamra' mound, then flows into Qanat valley. Al-Matri said: Wadi Jafaf, upper place in al-Awali east of Quba Mosque, then Wadi Mudhaynib east of Jafaf meets it and Jafaf above al-Shams Mosque, known anciently as al-Fadih Mosque then they flow into Bathan meet them and Ranuna in Bathan, pass Medina west of al-Musalla reach Fat'h Mosques as one flood and meets al-Aqiq at Bir Rumah, then Wadi Mahzur also east al-Awali north Mudhaynib, splits in eastern lava to al-Arid, then flows into al-Shathah valley, then al-Shathah valley comes from east Medina from distant places until reaching the dam made by the fire, the lava fire that appeared in Medina... with time and after breaching this dam and pressure of floods gathering behind it, al-Shathah flood took a wide course, flows into Rumah at floods confluence, Bathan flood and al-Aqiq and Zughabah and Naqma and Ghurab flood from al-Ghabah side, becomes one flood and takes in Wadi al-Dayqah to Idam, these all Medina valleys. Al-Samhudi said: Al-Majd quoted from Abu Ubaydah that the Jews when settled Medina settled in al-Safilah, disliked it sent a scout to al-Aliyah, saw Bathan and Mahzur descending from lava with sweet waters flowing, returned said: Found good land and valleys descending to lava sweet, moved. Banu al-Nadir settled on Bathan, Qurayzah on Mahzur. With preceding homes Nadir on Mudhaynib and homes al-Nawa'im if said their settlement on Bathan considered unity of origin, Mudhaynib flows into Bathan also. I said: From scholars' sayings understand Mudhaynib and Mahzur valleys emerge from al-Aliyah from eastern lava heading to Medina in separate courses, Mudhaynib meets Wadi Bathan, Banu al-Nadir homes in Mudhaynib narratives did not differ on this. Abd al-Quddus al-Ansari determining Mudhaynib and Mahzur sources: Wadi Mudhaynib we followed its course from east Ka'b bin al-Ashraf fortress, near the fortress forms semicircle center the fortress then overflows north Umm Arba' fa Umm Ashr, continues until mixes with Wadi Bathan at its start, on this valley Banu al-Nadir homes... mentioned Ka'b bin al-Ashraf fortress ruins still remain. As for Wadi Mahzur issues from Waqim lava Ibn Shabbah said: Takes from east this lava and from Hakr place water forty miles from Medina, and Safah lava until upper Banu Qurayzah Hala'ah, there splits into two branches one mixes with Mudhaynib, other goes until connects with Mudhaynib at Banu Khatmah space, then Mudhaynib and Mahzur join. Al-Shanqiti said: Eastern lava a clear ancient landmark of Medina, mentioned in Torah as migration of last time prophet; so Jews settled it Qaynuqa' and al-Nadir and Qurayzah awaiting him. Jews' homes in middle eastern lava; natural fortifications, for their much treachery sowing evil and igniting wars so only settle fortified villages. I said: Thus clear al-Buwayrah Banu al-Nadir homes in Wadi Mudhaynib where emerges from eastern lava the place raided by the Prophet (peace be upon him) cut their trees burned their palms expelled them (peace be upon him), their properties what God bestowed on His Messenger no horses or camels urged on. Thus known Banu al-Nadir and Qurayzah Jews homes. I said al-Buwayrah common names shared by several places will speak of places named this one by one God willing. Yaqut said: Al-Buwayrah also place near Wadi al-Qura, between it and Basitah. Passed by al-Mutanabbi mentioned in his poetry: Ramiy al-Kafaf and liver al-Wahad and neighbor al-Buwayrah Wadi al-Ghada. Hamd al-Jasir spoke of this place: Al-Buwayrah mountain west Wadi Ifal between it and Gulf of Aqaba, its flood descending west south flows into a valley called Wadi al-Jalib until overflows into Gulf of Aqaba north Bir al-Mashi near it, descending north west flows into Wadi al-Hasha to the Gulf, this mountain in Madian region west Husma, road to Haql fa al-Aqabah west of it, people there call it al-Bawarah, as Bedouins' habit replacing ya' with waw. Not unlikely it meant by al-Mutanabbi: Winds with my body north winds facing south wind's blow. Ramiy al-Kafaf and liver al-Wahad and neighbor al-Buwayrah Wadi al-Ghada. Traversed Bisitah traversal the veil between ostriches and gazelles. Al-Buwayrah also: Yaqut said place in Hawf Egypt. Al-Buwayrah also: Yaqut said village or well below Aja, in it said: We have a well east al-Alam ancient not dug after Iram with buckets guarded with thicket. Its name al-Laqitah. Hamd al-Jasir noticed al-Laqitah north east Aja, as if meaning al-Alam the mountain, thirty km from Hail city, one of Shammar villages. Al-Buwayrah also: Hamd al-Jasir said, al-Hazimi in al-Buldan, in hadith Asi al-Udhri visitor to the Messenger (peace be upon him), requested land in Wadi al-Qura, granted it today called Buwayrah Asi. This Buwayrah in Wadi al-Qura near al-Ula, other than the mountain previously determined. Al-Buwayrah also: Al-Bakri said: With dammah first, undotted ra' on diminutive form, from Tayma', cited news of Prophet's raid (peace be upon him) on Banu al-Nadir: Messenger of God (peace be upon him) burned Banu al-Nazir palms, cut flowers al-Buwayrah descended: (Whatever you cut of palms or left standing on roots by God's permission to disgrace the defiantly disobedient) Surah al-Hashr: 5. I said: Known from historians and exegetes' sayings Banu al-Nadir homes raided by Prophet (peace be upon him) in Medina as preceded, not in Tayma', this not prevent place in Tayma' called al-Buwayrah, unknown to us. Al-Buwayrah also: Al-Bakri determined in a valley called Burk beside Jabal Shawahit: Shawahit with dammah first, undotted ha' and ta': lofty mountain... this mountain many leopards and ibex, many ravines grows ghadur and thagham. Antar said: I said appear caravan I see it settling Shawahit dusk's wing. Beside it a valley called Burk, much vegetation with water called al-Buwayrah, sweet water. Hamd al-Jasir said: Known Jabal Shawahit near al-Suwarqiyah village still known, al-Suwarqiyah villages under Medina, but three days camel from it. Al-Buwayrah also: Al-Bakri mentioned determined on road between Medina and Tayma' between Mithib and Ara'ir. These places known as al-Buwayrah, but some no longer known this name in this era. Al-Buwayrah also: Diminutive well Hejaz railway station km north west Medina, in Wuld Muhammad from Harb lands, perhaps this Buwayrah Asi. Said Atik al-Biladi. Al-Buwayrah also: With open unified ba' and waw silent dual ya' open undotted ra' then ha': spot in Wadi Qasi toward Bilghazi said Muhammad al-Aqili.","Translation":"The story talks about Al-Buwayrah, the homes of Bani Al-Nadir in Medina. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, raided them, burned their palms, and cut their crops six months after Uhud. There are different places named Al-Buwayrah, like Wadi Bathan and Al-Buwaylah, fortresses of Bani Al-Nadir, and another known as Tayma."},{"Place":"Bayt al-Muqaddas","City":"Jerusalem - Palestine","Description":"Intended is al-Masjid al-Aqsa the known.

The Jews liked when he prayed toward Bayt al-Muqaddas and People of the Book, when turned his face toward the House they denied that. Yaqut said: Al-Muqaddas in language: the purified, interpreters on His saying: (We glorify with Your praise and sanctify for You) Surah al-Baqarah 30, al-Zajjaj: meaning we purify ourselves for You, and do to who obeys You, purify them.

Al-Bukhari narrated from Aisha wife of the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: We went out with the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) in some travels until al-Bayda' or Dhat al-Jaysh my necklace broke; the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) stayed seeking it and people stayed with him not on water... to end of hadith, God revealed tayammum verse so they did tayammum. Narrated from Anas (may God be pleased with him) said the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) prayed with us in Medina Zuhr four, Asr at Dhi al-Hulayfah two, stayed till morning, rode till leveled on al-Bayda' praised God glorified and magnified, ihram for Hajj and Umrah people did too. Ibn Hajar said: Al-Bayda' is Dhi al-Hulayfah near Medina. Al-Matri said: I saw many pilgrims pass around the mosque - meaning Dhi al-Hulayfah mosque - west and ascend to al-Bayda' pass the miqat certainly, the Prophet (peace be upon him) says: Medina people's ihram from Dhi al-Hulayfah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) ihram from Dhi al-Hulayfah, when his mount leveled on al-Bayda' ihram for Hajj, likewise Abdullah bin Umar (may God be pleased with them): Not your Bayda' you lie about the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), the Messenger of God ihram only from near the mosque meaning Dhi al-Hulayfah all supports not exceed the mosque and around if intending ihram. Yaqut said: Al-Bayda': name for flat land between Mecca and Medina closer to Mecca, counted from the honor before Dhi al-Hulayfah... every desert nothing in it al-Bayda'. I said: His saying closer to Mecca: not meaning distance to Mecca closer than to Medina, but meaning closer to Mecca than Dhi al-Hulayfah, both al-Bayda' and Dhi al-Hulayfah near Medina. As for Ibn Hajar's saying Dhi al-Hulayfah meaning al-Bayda' in his commentary on the second hadith. Said: But Muslim from Abu Hassan from Ibn Abbas: the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed Zuhr at Dhi al-Hulayfah, called his she-camel marked it then rode his mount, when leveled on al-Bayda' ihram for Hajj. Nasa'i from al-Hasan from Anas: he (peace be upon him) prayed Zuhr at al-Bayda' then rode. Reconciled he prayed at end Dhi al-Hulayfah and start al-Bayda' God knows. Al-Bakri said: Al-Bayda': the honor before Dhi al-Hulayfah on Mecca road, then mentioned some preceding hadiths. In al-Maghanim al-Mutabah al-Majd said: Medina historians said: Al-Bayda' if pilgrims after ihram from Dhi al-Hulayfah face it ascending west, mentioned in Aisha's hadith (may God be pleased with her): until al-Bayda' or Dhat al-Jaysh. In al-Bayda' tayammum verse descended. Al-Samhudi said: Start al-Bayda' at end Dhi al-Hulayfah, marks between them; thus Asadi in counting road marks: On Medina exit two marks, Dhi al-Hulayfah entry two marks, Dhi al-Hulayfah exit two marks, said elsewhere al-Bayda' above Dhi al-Hulayfah marks ascending from valley, start al-Bayda' a well. As if al-Bayda' between Dhi al-Hulayfah and Dhat al-Jaysh. Al-Shanqiti said: Al-Bayda': vast desert. Poet said: Like donkeys in desert thirst kills them water on their backs carried. Al-Bayda' here wide land ascended by going from Medina ihram to Mecca flat, west Dhi al-Hulayfah, between Dhi al-Hulayfah and Dhat al-Jaysh, mentioned in prophetic hadith: People raid Medina, when settle al-Bayda' God sends Gabriel says O Bayda' destroy them. Mentioned in Aisha's hadith cause tayammum descent: until al-Bayda' or Dhat al-Jaysh..... This means end Dhi al-Hulayfah start al-Bayda' today Medina TV station in them. End al-Bayda' Dhat al-Jaysh wide plain after al-Bayda', split by valley this name, right reddish hillocks not high west bridge intersection Jeddah road with pilgrims road connected to Hijrah expressway, after bridge security center. I said: Thus clear al-Bayda' mentioned in hadith location relative to Medina, developments on it modern urban landmarks represented by building roads crossing it and bridges, and urban facilities in this era.","Translation":"This story talks about Al-Bayda', a flat land between Mecca and Medina, close to Medina and important for ihram for Medina for Hajj and Umrah. The text covers the Prophetic hadith and Quranic verse on tayammum when Aisha's necklace was lost, may God be pleased with her, and Al-Bayda's location relative to Dhul-Hulayfah Mosque. It also mentions historians' opinions on Al-Bayda's site and its modern features like roads, bridges, and urban facilities today."},{"Place":"Birha'","City":"Medina","Description":"Al-Bukhari narrated from Anas bin Malik (may God be pleased with him) saying: Abu Talhah most Ansar in Medina wealth from palms, most beloved his wealth Birha', facing the mosque, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) entered it drank from good water there. Anas (may God be pleased with him) said when descended this verse: (You will not attain righteousness until you spend from what you love) Surah Al Imran: 92, Abu Talhah stood to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: O Messenger of God God Blessed and Exalted says: You will not attain righteousness until spend from what you love most beloved my wealth Birha', charity for God hope its righteousness and store with God place it O Messenger of God where God shows you. Said the Messenger of God (peace be upon him): Bravo that profitable wealth that profitable wealth. Ibn Hajar said: Bayraha': open unified ba', silent sub ya', open ra', undotted ha' med, came in vocalization many ways, Ibn al-Athir in al-Nihayah collected said: Narrated open ba' and closed, open ra' and dammah, med and qasr these eight dialects. In Hammad bin Salama narration: Bariha, open first closed ra' preceding it sub ya', in Sunan Abu Dawud Bariha, like but adding alif. Al-Baji said: Most eloquent open ba' silent ya' open ra' qasr, likewise Sajani asserted. Said: Fi'ala from al-Barah. Some closed unified ba' thought a well from Medina wells erred. In al-Nihayah in Abu Talhah hadith (most beloved my wealth Bayrha' this word often narrators differ: open ba' and closed, open ra' and dammah, med in both, open both and qasr, name property and place in Medina. Al-Zamakhshari in al-Fa'iq: Fi'ula from al-Barah, apparent land. Al-Suhayli Birha' some mentioned this well named Birha' by driving camels from it, camels said when driven from water: Ha ha, thus Asili records it raising ra' if name raised, med. Others Asili say: Open ra' all cases qasr make single name. Heard from some Birha open ba' qasr, in Sahih Abu Talhah handed Birha' to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) made charity, the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered make it relatives. In al-Maghanim al-Mutabah al-Majd said: Birha well and garden north city wall east side, became Birha for Ubayy bin Ka'b and Hassan bin Thabit (may God be pleased with them) when Abu Talhah (may God be pleased with him) handed to them as in the two Sahihs and others. People differed vocalizing this word mentioned al-Zamakhshari's preceding saying said Abu Bakr al-Baji: Abu Bakr al-Asam denied declension in ra' said: Only open ra' all cases. Abu Abdullah al-Suri said: Only open ba' and ra' all cases meaning single word. Qadi Iyad said: On Andalusians narration we vocalized this letter from Abu Ja'far in Muslim book closed ba' open ra' closed ra' open ba' qasr vocalized in al-Muwatta from Ibn Attab and Ibn Hamdun and others. Damma ra' open with it recorded from Asili. Heard no difference except found al-Humaydi mentioned from Hammad bin Salama Birha as al-Suri said, al-Razi narration in Sahih Muslim from Malik bin Anas Bariha error, this in Hammad hadith, as for Malik hadith Birha as all vocalized differing. Abu Dawud in his Musnad mentioned this hadith contrary preceding: Made land Bariha, all indicates not well. Said place near mosque known Qasr Banu Judaylah. Ibn Ishaq mentioned Hassan bin Thabit (may God be pleased with him) when spoke in al-Ifk what spoke, Quran descended innocence Aisha (may God be pleased with her), Safwan bin al-Mu'attal attacked Hassan struck with sword, Ansar complained to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) Safwan's act gave him compensation for strike Birha and it Qasr Banu Judaylah today in Medina, property Abu Talhah bin Sahl charity to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) gave to Hassan, gave Shirin Coptic slave bore him Abd al-Rahman bin Hassan. Some traditionists authored verifying vocalization Birha book, these lines contain its essence God willing. In Birha well near bucket narrow courtyard good water, before it south small mosque middle garden, today endowment poor needy, palms guaranteed, Medina people prefer guaranteed palms over irrigated not dates over dates, prefer because yields fruit to owner without effort and toil. Yaqut Birha like Khayzala, Abu al-Qasim bin Umar said: Said Birha added med, said Birha open first and ra' qasr, Maghribis all addition and ra' declension raising lowering installing, ha' like ha' letters dictionary. Said: Land for Abu Talhah, said: Place near mosque known Qasr Banu Judaylah, mentioned Hassan bin Thabit news when Safwan bin al-Mu'attal attacked struck with sword the Prophet (peace be upon him) gave Birha compensation for strike. Al-Waqidi mentioned assault Safwan bin al-Mu'attal on Hassan bin Thabit, Safwan detained in his right, when Hassan recovered from strike Sa'd bin Ubadah spoke to Hassan bin Thabit requesting waive right on Safwan, Hassan came in his people stood before the Messenger of God said: O Messenger of God all my right before Safwan bin al-Mu'attal yours, said: You did well accepted that; the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) gave land Baraha, Birja and around, Sirin, Sa'd bin Ubadah gave garden much wealth compensation for waiving his right. I said: Thus scholars differed vocalizing Birha as differed defining it garden with palms and well, or well, or land Barah, but Medina historians differ defining from who said land not well nor palm garden. Saying not well nor palm garden rejected by explicit authentic hadith: Facing the mosque the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) entered shaded drank from good water there. Al-Matri said after citing Anas hadith Bukhari narrated complete: This well middle small garden with good palms north city wall between it and wall road, now - his time - al-Nuwayriyah bought by some Nuwayri women endowed poor needy arrivals departures... as mentioned facing mosque. Shaykh Muhibb al-Din bin al-Najjar (may God mercy him): Measured length twenty cubits eleven water rest building, width three cubits little. Al-Samhudi said after narrating Anas hadith Bukhari narrated: In his narration after (most beloved my wealth Birha') said: Garden the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) entered shaded drank from its water. Ibn al-Najjar said Birha today middle very small garden with palms planted around, house built above ground near city wall some its people, water sweet fresh. Al-Samhudi said: Today - his time - this description south small mosque not from ancients building not mentioned by Ibn al-Najjar nor al-Matri perhaps after them. Mentioned the mosque in Birha well near bucket narrow courtyard good water, before it south small mosque middle garden. His saying in authentic hadith facing mosque meaning mosque its qiblah direction not contradict distance from it this distance existing today. Ahmad al-Abbasi said: Birha: Well and garden north city wall east side, became Birha for Ubayy bin Ka'b, Hassan bin Thabit handed by Abu Talhah as in two Sahihs and others... near bucket narrow courtyard before it south small mosque middle garden, endowment poor needy, palms guaranteed, Medina people prefer guaranteed palm, prefer because yields fruit to owner freely without toil. Abd al-Quddus al-Ansari said: Birha. This well outside city wall - before demolishing city wall - near it north east Medina, away from nearest point to it from wall about (13) meters in sloping alley, opening in it, lined with stones bottom to near opening. Differs shape from Medina wells, Birha square. Others round above Birha small arch red brick. Today - year authoring this book 1353 AH - mostly as al-Samhudi described; not middle garden but home corner belonging to it or it to it, east small barren land piece with two thirsty palms, perhaps remnants its mentioned garden. Al-Shanqiti said: Birha north Prophet's Mosque known now Bab al-Majidi about (84) meters from Prophet's Mosque, east Qasr al-Madina hotel, on this well since saw 1378 AH building roofed south window possible look from to well inside building, this year 1405 AH found that window closed paper box, still near well east one or two palms remnants garden in it, saw written on surrounding homes walls order refer Medina municipality with ownership deeds, decided remove this neighborhood Prophet's Haram expansion project, what east neighborhood removed became cars parking, wished named Birha. In this garden well in was home Umm Sulaym bint Milhan and husband Abu Talhah al-Ansari (may God be pleased with them). I said: From preceding confirmed Birha garden palms with good water well, north east Prophet's Mosque, owned Abu Talhah al-Ansari (may God be pleased with him), charity as in authentic hadith. Confirmed this well transferred to Hassan bin Thabit and Ubayy bin Ka'b, its land some parts sold caused disappearance its palms and trees, this well remained place thriving till recent era.","Translation":"The story of Bir Ha' relates to a garden with water owned by the companion Abu Talha Al-Ansari.

Ibn Hisham said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) stayed Medina between Dhu al-Hijjah to Rajab, ordered companions prepare raid Romans, time people's hardship severe heat land drought fruits ripe, people love stay fruits shades hate departure time they on, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) rarely went raid except alluded other than direction heads, except Tabuk raid clarified people, long distance severe time enemy multitude prepare accordingly preparation their raid, ordered people equipment informed Romans.

The Prophet urged people to prepare and equip for this arduous journey, leading Uthman bin Affan to spend a large amount equipping the army, while hypocrites like Ibn Abi stayed behind from participating. The story's events include confronting a hypocrite who claimed the Prophet, peace be upon him, could not face the Romans due to the weakness of Bani Al-Asfar. Nevertheless, the Prophet and Muslims continued their journey until reaching Tabuk, where they stayed and made peace with its people on paying tribute.The event also witnessed signs of prophethood like providing water and food, leading to some tribes converting to Islam after knowing the Prophet's strength and message's truth. The Prophet concluded the expedition peacefully without major military confrontation, by God's grace and the Prophet's determination, peace be upon him, and his companions in executing this mission despite severe difficulties faced during the journey."},{"Place":"Ta'ahn","City":"Al-Madinah al-Munawwarah","Description":"Place homes three miles from al-Suqya between Mecca Medina.

Historians spoke Tayma' described clearly, Al-Bakri said: Tayma' open first med weight Fa'la', one mothers villages said: Salih's reconciliation its people the Messenger of God (peace be upon him). Al-Sukuni: Travel Medina intending Tayma', descend al-Sahba' Ashja', then Ashmadhin Ashja', then al-Ayn, then Salah Banu Udhrah, then travel three nights al-Jinab, then descend Tayma' Tay'. Malik bin al-Nabighah dwelt al-Jinab, between it Tayma' al-Ablaq al-Fard fortress, al-Samwal dwelt says A'isha: At al-Ablaq al-Fard Tayma' home fortress fortified neighbor no betrayer. Tayma': City wall, shore lake length parasang called al-Aqirah, river called Nahr Fayha', much palms figs grapes, many Banu Juwayn from Tay', Banu Amr others.

No doubt Judaism spread Tayma', but inhabitants not Jews, Arabs pure Qahtan from Ghassan, Jews not able that era penetrate Tayma' located deep between Qahtan dwellings west north east, Adnan dwellings south south west. As for the Prophet's reconciliation (peace be upon him) its people on jizyah, reconciled Arabs on it, as did with al-Akidar al-Kindi his people Dumat al-Jandal inhabitants, Banu Kalb from Qahtan, as his companions after took jizyah Banu Taghlib, Rabi'ah from Adnan for remaining their Christianity.

Numerous authentic narrations mention this location. For example, in Sahih al-Bukhari, Abdullah ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) raced horses from Al-Hafya to Thaniyyat al-Wada‘. Another narration by Al-Sa’ib ibn Yazid (may Allah be pleased with him) states that he went with children to greet the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) at Thaniyyat al-Wada‘ upon his return from the Battle of Tabuk. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) also set up camp there before expeditions like Khaybar, Tabuk, and Mutah. Scholars like Ibn Kathir, Al-Waqidi, Ibn Qayyim, and Al-Samhudi confirm that this pass is located to the north of Madinah, near landmarks like Mount Sila‘ and Masjid al-Rayah. There has been historical debate about whether there is another Thaniyyat al-Wada‘ to the south, near the route to Makkah, and some scholars suggested the well-known welcoming chant \"The full moon rose upon us...\" was sung by the Ansari women and children at the southern pass when the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) first arrived in Madinah. However, stronger historical and geographical evidence suggests that the chant was more likely sung at the northern pass, which was the Prophet’s route during his return from northern expeditions. Later historians and geographers reconciled the differing views by concluding that there were likely two passes referred to as Thaniyyat al-Wada‘ — one in the north used for travel to and from Syria, and one in the south toward Makkah. Both were associated with farewells and greetings of travelers, which explains the shared name. The northern pass, in particular, is supported by the strongest narrations and was long identified as a key route used by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in his travels.","Translation":"This story talks about \"\"Thaniyat Al-Wada'\"\" a known site in Medina where the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, bid farewell to travelers upon leaving. Thaniyat Al-Wada' was used to farewell those going to Mecca and the Levant, and to console women who were enjoyed, according to multiple narrations and different opinions on its location and naming. The story talks about several expeditions led by the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, the Khaibar and Tabuk expeditions, and people's reception of him in Medina upon returning from expeditions. It covered scholars' opinions on determining Thaniyat Al-Wada's location, naming history, and multiple naming reasons, showing differences between early and later scholars on this topic. This story highlights the history and importance of Thaniyat Al-Wada' in the noble Prophetic biography and shows jurisprudential and historical disputes around it."},{"Place":"Thawr","City":"Al-Madinah al-Munawwarah","Description":"A well-known mountain in the city of Medina. Al-Bukhari narrated from Ali, who said: “We have no book to read except the Book of God, apart from this scroll.” Then he took it out, and it contained rules about injuries and the age of camels. It also stated: \"Medina is a sacred area between the mountains of Ayr and Thawr. Whoever commits an offense in it, or shelters an offender, upon him is the curse of God, the angels, and all people. Nothing will be accepted from him on the Day of Judgment — neither voluntary acts nor compensation.\" In the book Al-Maghanim Al-Mutaba, Al-Majd wrote that Thawr — which shares its name with the word for a bull — is a small mountain facing Mount Uhud, leaning slightly behind it. Some scholars have confirmed that behind Mount Uhud, on its northern side, there is a small round mountain called Thawr, known among the people of Medina and passed down through generations. When this information was not known to Abu Ubayd, he rejected the narration and claimed that the people of Medina were unaware of any mountain there called Thawr, asserting instead that Thawr exists only in Mecca. Therefore, he interpreted the narration as referring to the area between Ayr and Uhud, or he claimed that the word \"to\" in the phrase meant \"along with,\" as if Medina's sacredness was tied to Mecca. Others also proposed forced explanations. The writer of the book criticizes this rush to dismiss a well-authenticated narration just because people in Medina at that time did not recognize a mountain named Thawr. The most they could say is that they asked some of the local residents — not necessarily all of them — long after many generations had passed, and those asked did not know the name. However, it is well-known that names of places and landmarks often change or fall out of use due to various reasons. The original names are sometimes abandoned and replaced based on new developments or events. For example, where is the location once known as the Saqifah of Banu Sa’idah? Or the area once called Dhu al-Hulayfah, which today is only known as Bir Ali? If someone were to use the old name today, it would sound unfamiliar, as if they invented it. Even more strange, when the writer asked many nobles, scholars, and common people in Medina about the location of Fadak, they all gave the same answer: they had no knowledge of such a place. And yet, that village remained in the hands of leaders up until the end of the Abbasid era. So what can be expected of a small mountain on the edge of Uhud with no political importance? After giving more similar examples, the writer concludes that all those interpretations are mere guesswork from people who simply lacked knowledge of the mountain called Thawr in Medina. The scholar Al-Matari mentioned that another scholar, Al-Mazari, said the reference to Thawr in Medina must be a mistake by the narrator, since Thawr is in Mecca. But others like Abu Ubayd stated that Ayr and Thawr are two mountains in Medina, though the locals no longer recognized a mountain by the name of Thawr. One writer responded: “Actually, behind Mount Uhud, on its northern side, there is a small round mountain called Thawr, and another mountain to the east called Uwayrah, and they are the boundaries of Medina’s sacred area.” Perhaps the name Thawr had not reached Abu Ubayd or Al-Mazari, but that does not mean it did not exist. If it were not widely known, it would not have been passed down through generations. Another scholar, Al-Fassi, confirmed that Thawr is indeed a mountain in Medina and is part of the city's sacred boundary, as mentioned in the narration reported by Muslim. He described it as a very small mountain located to the left of Mount Uhud. Many knowledgeable locals and historians affirmed this. The historian Al-Samhudi also confirmed that Thawr is a small mountain behind Mount Uhud and that many leading scholars were unaware of it, which led to their confusion about the narration. He criticized the scholars who denied the mountain’s existence simply because they hadn’t heard of it, and emphasized that names of places are often forgotten over time. He shared examples of people who visited Mecca and could not identify certain valleys related to pilgrimage, even though they were frequently visited. He also pointed out that some places can have more than one name, and one may become obscure. Al-Samhudi quoted other scholars like Al-Bayhaqi, who reported Abu Ubayd’s earlier claim that the mountain didn’t exist, but later wrote that he had heard of a mountain in Medina called Thawr. Another geographer said Ayr is a mountain facing a well-known mountain pass, and Thawr is a mountain near Uhud. This proves that the Thawr of Medina was known in older times, even if it became less known later. Many people confirmed its presence behind Uhud. A well-known scholar from Basra who lived in Medina stated that he saw it multiple times. During a journey to Iraq, he was with a guide who, upon reaching Uhud, pointed to a nearby small mountain and called it Thawr. Another trusted scholar, Al-Tabari, said a reliable and knowledgeable man told him there is a small mountain to the left of Uhud called Thawr. This man had asked many knowledgeable locals, and they all confirmed that the mountain’s name was Thawr. This proves that the narration was authentic, and the scholars who missed it did so only because of its lack of fame and their limited research. Another researcher said that he investigated the name Thawr with the locals in Medina and found it to be the name of a small mountain behind Uhud, known to older generations but unfamiliar to many in modern times. And those who do know are proof against those who do not. The famous scholar Ibn Taymiyyah stated clearly: Ayr is a mountain near the pilgrimage station and resembles a donkey in shape, while Thawr is a mountain near Uhud and is not the same as the Thawr in Mecca. Another historian, Abdul Quddus Al-Ansari, described the two mountains of Medina: Ayr is a large towering mountain to the south of the city, about two hours on foot, and Thawr is a small red mountain to the north of Uhud, marking the southern and northern boundaries of Medina’s sacred area. Finally, historian Atiq Al-Balladi described Thawr as a red, rounded mountain at the southern edge of a valley, very close to the northern side of Uhud. A path between the two allowed non-Muslims to avoid entering Medina. The mountain lies about 17 kilometers north of the city. With all these statements from scholars confirming and describing the location of the mountain called Thawr in Medina — despite early disagreements or denials — the confusion is resolved. Its existence is established through both historical accounts and direct observation. There are other places named Thawr, such as a valley in the region of Muzaynah, and a place called Thawr al-Shibbak, as noted by Yaqut.","Translation":"This story talks about scholars' differences in determining the location of Mount \"Thawr\" in Medina. Some deny this mountain's existence entirely, while others confirm it based on narrations and people knowing it behind Mount Uhud from the north, close to Wadi Al-Naqmi."},{"Place":"Al-Thawr","City":"Al-Summan","Description":"Thawr is also the name of a location in the region of Al-Summan, to which the name \"Barqah\" is added — this was mentioned by Yaqut in his geographical dictionary and by other scholars as well. Today, the name refers to a valley, one of the most well-known in the Al-Summan area, surrounded by land formations known as \"barq\" (plural of \"barqah\"). It lies to the west of the area historically known as Al-Lisafah by about fifty kilometers. One of the roads that passes through this area is called Al-Mansharihah, which leads toward the Najd region. Nearby is another valley called the Valley of Thawr, with the road running between the two. This was mentioned by Hamad Al-Jasir. Thawr is also the name of a modern village belonging to the Anzah tribe, located in a valley west of Mount Atwah. The village contains newly built residences, palm trees, and wells, and is part of the greater Khaybar area. This was stated by Atiq Al-Balladi.","Translation":"This story talks about a place named \"Thawr\" in Al-Saman. Yacout Al-Hamawi mentioned it in Mu'jam Al-Buldan, and others did too.

Al-Bukhari narrated from Ya'la who said to Umar - may Allah be pleased with him - 'Show me the Prophet, peace be upon him, when revelation comes to him.' He said, 'While the Prophet, peace be upon him, was at Al-Ja'ranah with a group of his companions, a man came and said: O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of a man who entered ihram for Umrah while scented with perfume? The Prophet, peace be upon him, remained silent for a while, then revelation came. Umar signaled to Ya'la, who came while the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was covered with a garment as a shade. He put his head in, and behold, the face of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was red, and he was snoring... the hadith continues. Ibn Hajar said: As for Al-Ja'ranah, it is with a kasrah on the jim and the unmarked 'ayn, with tashdid on the ra', and the 'ayn may be silent. It is between Ta'if and Makkah, closer to Makkah, as said by Iyadh. Al-Fakihi said between it and Makkah is a barid, and Al-Baji: eighteen miles. Al-Dawudi denied the commentator's statement that Al-Ja'ranah is between Makkah and Madinah, saying it is between Makkah and Ta'if, and Al-Nawawi affirmed that Al-Ja'ranah is between Ta'if and Makkah, as required by what was previously quoted from Al-Fakihi and others. Yaqut said: Al-Ja'ranah with a kasrah at the beginning unanimously, then the people of hadith give kasrah to its 'ayn and tashdid to its ra', while the people of precision and literature fault them and make the 'ayn silent and lighten the ra'. It was narrated from Al-Shafi'i that he said: The traditionists err in giving tashdid to Al-Ja'ranah and lightening Al-Hudaybiyah. Up to here from what I quoted, and what we have is that they are two good narrations. Ismail ibn Al-Qadi narrated from Ali ibn Al-Madini that he said: The people of Madinah thicken it and thicken Al-Hudaybiyah, while the people of Iraq lighten both. The madhhab of Al-Shafi'i is to lighten Al-Ja'ranah, and he heard from the Arabs those who thicken it, and with lightening Al-Khattabi restricted it: it is a water between Ta'if and Makkah, closer to Makkah. The Prophet, peace be upon him, descended there when he distributed the spoils of Hawazin, returning from the battle of Hunayn, and entered ihram from there, peace be upon him. He has a mosque there and wells close together. As for in poetry, we have not heard it except lightened, he said: Would that today her house were in Al-Ja'ranah and my house between Sham and Kabkab, so I would see her among the muhrims for a while in the valley of Mina throwing pebbles at Al-Mahsub. Abu Al-Abbas Al-Qadi said: The best Umrah for the people of Makkah and those neighboring it is from Al-Ja'ranah because the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, performed Umrah from it, and it is from Makkah a barid on the Iraq road. If that is missed, then from Al-Tan'im. Al-Fasi said: It is known among the people of the Sira that the Prophet, peace be upon him, reached Al-Ja'ranah on Thursday night, five nights into Dhu Al-Qa'dah, and stayed there thirteen nights. When he intended to depart to Madinah, he left on Wednesday night, twelve nights remaining in Dhu Al-Qa'dah, at night, entered ihram for Umrah, and entered Makkah. Al-Ja'ranah is the best miqat for Umrah from Makkah; the Prophet, peace be upon him, entered ihram from this place, according to the madhhab of Malik, Al-Shafi'i, Ibn Hanbal, and others among the scholars. Al-Waqidi said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, reached Al-Ja'ranah on Thursday night, five nights into Dhu Al-Qa'dah, stayed in Al-Ja'ranah thirteen, then when he intended to depart to Madinah, he left Al-Ja'ranah on Wednesday night, twelve remaining in Dhu Al-Qa'dah, at night, entered ihram from the farthest mosque below the valley at the farthest side - as for this nearer mosque, a man from Quraysh built it and made that wall with him - and the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, did not cross the valley except in ihram, continuing to make talbiyah until he touched the corner. It is said: When he looked at the House, he cut the talbiyah. Then the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, departed to Al-Ja'ranah that night, as if he spent the night there. When he returned to Al-Ja'ranah, he left on Thursday, proceeded in the valley of Al-Ja'ranah and proceeded with him until he ascended Sarif, then took the road until he reached Marr Az-Zahran... and arrived in Madinah on Friday, three nights remaining in Dhu Al-Qa'dah. I say: From what preceded, it is clear the scholars differ in the pronunciation of Al-Ja'ranah, between kasrah on the 'ayn and its sukun, and between thickening the ra' and lightening it. Yaqut mentioned the sayings of the two groups and said: What we have is that they are two good narrations. They also differed in determining the distance between Makkah and Al-Ja'ranah. I say: Al-Ja'ranah is a place that has retained its name over the past centuries and is still known by it; nothing has changed. Atiq Al-Biladi visited it and described it well while observing its landmarks, saying: Al-Ja'ranah originally a well located northeast of Makkah at the head of Wadi Sarif, which is called by it there, then it was taken as Umrah in emulation of the Messenger's Umrah from it after the siege of Ta'if. Today there is a large mosque and a small orchard overlooking it from the northeast, Jabal Azlam. It is connected to Makkah by a paved road extending to Wadi Az-Zubarah. Al-Ja'ranah is eleven kilometers from the sign of the Najd road... and its water is proverbially sweet, transported to Makkah as gifts, and there is little descent. He mentioned that the distance between the sign of the Najd road and Makkah is approximately fifteen kilometers, so the distance between Al-Ja'ranah and Makkah is approximately twenty-six kilometers, and the road to it is good asphalt. This is a summary of what Atiq Al-Biladi and others described of the place that retained its Islamic significance.","Translation":"This story talks about a place called Al-Ju'ranah, east of Mecca, where the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, descended and distributed Hawazin's spoils after Hunayn. Scholars differed in pronouncing Al-Ju'ranah between kasr ain and sakinah, and thaqil ra' and khafif, and it is one of Umrah's important miqats for Mecca's people."},{"Place":"Al-Jamrah","City":"Makkah Al-Mukarramah (Mina)","Description":"The place of throwing pebbles in Mina. Al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih from Abdullah ibn Amr: I saw the Prophet, peace be upon him, at Al-Jamrah while he was being asked. A man said: O Messenger of Allah, I slaughtered before throwing. He said: Throw, no harm. Another said: O Messenger of Allah, I shaved before slaughtering. He said: Slaughter, no harm. He was not asked about anything advanced or delayed except he said: Do it, no harm. Al-Bakri said: The Jamrah in Makkah is known, the place of throwing pebbles. The greater Jamrah is Jamrat Al-Aqabah. Shu'bah ibn Al-Hakam narrated from Ibrahim ibn Abd Al-Rahman ibn Yazid that Ibn Mas'ud, when he reached the greater Jamrah, placed the House on his left and Mina on his right, and threw seven pebbles, saying: Thus threw the one upon whom Surah Al-Baqarah was revealed. Al-Fasi said: The Jamrat in Mina, and he quoted from Ibn Sayyidah the linguist what implies it is at Arafah, which is undoubtedly a mistake. We mentioned it for its strangeness, as Al-Suhayli mentioned in Al-Rawd Al-Unuf, quoting from Ibn Sayyidah in Al-Muhkam and correcting him, then saying: He said - meaning Ibn Sayyidah - in the Jamrat elsewhere, it is thrown at Arafah, and this is a slip not to be said, and a stumble not for the learned, and how many such he has when speaking of genealogy and other. The first is next to Masjid Al-Khayf, the middle between it and Jamrat Al-Aqabah, and the last is Jamrat Al-Aqabah, closest to Makkah. Throwing in this order is required according to Imam Malik, and if done otherwise without remedying in the time of performance, which is daytime famously, the doer owes blood. Al-Azraqi mentioned the distance between the Jamrat: From Jamrat Al-Aqabah, the first towards Makkah, to the middle Jamrah four hundred and thirty-seven cubits and twelve fingers, from the middle to the third next to Masjid Mina three hundred and five cubits, from the one next to Masjid Mina to the middle of the mosque doors one thousand three hundred and twenty-one cubits. Yaqut said: Jamrat with kasrah plural of jamrah, the pebble, name of a place in Mina, the three Jamrat. Ibn Al-Kalbi said: Named because when Abraham threw at Iblis, he jumped from place to place, i.e., leaped. Ibn Al-Kalbi recited: When I moved my spur, it leaped. A poet said: When you come to the top of the Jamrat, turn to a dwelling in Al-Khayf not blameworthy, and say may Allah water from one with longing to you on what I knew resident. And: The Jamrah is the place of throwing pebbles in Mina, named Jamrat Al-Aqabah and the greater Jamrah because it is thrown on the day of sacrifice. Al-Dawudi said: Jamrat Al-Aqabah at the end of Mina towards Makkah, and the Aqabah to which the Jamrah is attributed is not from Mina. The first and middle Jamrat are both above Masjid Al-Khayf towards Makkah. Al-Fakihi mentioned poems mentioning the Jamrat, including Umar ibn Abi Rabi'ah: It was the day of Jamrat from what Allah decreed upon us and wrote with pens, I wished I were armor and izaar for you and ornament in a necklace. Al-Arji said: For throwing, the beauties show their hands, parting with takbir from a deep gorge. O Lord, a lover with us who does not reach us tomorrow when the pilgrims are driven to slaughter, tomorrow the people of Jam' meet with pebbles, likewise the farthest Jamrah those with no change. O Lord, a distant griever and lamenter when he sees the tent pegs removed for departure. Majnun Bani Amir said: I did not see Layla after a moment's stand in the valley of Mina throwing pebbles at Al-Mahsub, the pebbles from her if thrown from the armor edges of the fingers dyed. When she saw the sudden separation and we when we part branch, she signaled with a marked as if its fingers upon it the pleats from damask gilded. Alas, what I left, O Umm Malik, an echo wherever the wind takes it goes. Another poet said: I am a man haunted by her memory three Mina for that my patience and stands at the two Mash'ars for her and views the Jamrat and the slaughter. Another said: She says who throws the Jamrat in the evening showing us from her dyed fingers, tomorrow the pilgrims depart from the valley of Makkah and the tribes separate east and west. So I despaired and invoked, when she spoke it, and said to her: The eyes pour with tears. Another: I covenant the tribe on the night of the sleepless at the side of the farthest Jamrah to the hair. Is there return for time in its turning or a night passed from you not return. This is some of what Al-Fakihi mentioned of poetry about the Jamrat. I say: From what preceded of the scholars' sayings in describing the Jamrat and locating it in Mina, it is clear their agreement on its site, and the legitimacy of throwing in Hajj. Jamrah is mentioned singular and plural (jamrah), (jamrat), (jamr), all meaning the place of throwing pebbles in Mina collectively and individually, no disagreement. The Jamrat are among the rituals immortalized by Islamic legislation in the Hajj obligation, its name, site, throwing pebbles in Hajj, and its fame dispense with prolonging talk about it.","Translation":"This story talks about the site of throwing pebbles in Mina, an important part of Hajj rituals. The text mentions Prophetic hadiths on facilitating for some pilgrims who performed acts incorrectly. It also covers scholars' and poets' opinions on the jamarat and their location, explaining general agreement on throwing's legitimacy in Hajj and this site's importance in Islamic rituals."},{"Place":"Jam'","City":"Makkah Al-Mukarramah (Muzdalifah)","Description":"A name of Al-Muzdalifah. Al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih from Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them: The Prophet, peace be upon him, combined Maghrib and Isha at Jam', each with iqamah, without sunnah between or after either. Ibn Hajar said Jam' with fathah on jim and sukun on mim, i.e., Al-Muzdalifah, named Jam' because Adam met Eve there, and approached her. From Qatadah, named Jam' for combining two prayers. Or described by its people's action as they gather and draw near to Allah by standing there. Named Al-Muzdalifah for people's gathering, or nearing Mina, or departing from it all, or descending in every part of the night, or a place of nearness to Allah, or Adam's nearing Eve there. Al-Fakihi from Ibn Abbas: Jam' from the overflow of Al-Ma'zamayn to the peak behind Wadi Muhassir... From Ata similarly, except: until reaching the red peak short of Muhassir on the right of one leaving Makkah. Al-Muzdalifah named for people's departing from it, not staying a full day. Narrated from Ibn Mas'ud: Allah descended Adam, peace be upon him, to India, and Eve to Jeddah, neither knowing the other's place until they met at Jam', named for their meeting. From Ibn Abbas: Al-Fadl ibn Abbas told me: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, gave me a ride behind him the morning of Jam'. He pushed with us a Bedouin man with a daughter. The Messenger turned and saw me looking at her intensely, so he turned my head away from her, continuing talbiyah until throwing the Jamrah. From Ata: I said to Ata: Where is Al-Muzdalifah? He said: When you overflow from Arafah's Ma'zamayn to Muhassir. The Ma'zamayn are not Arafah's from Al-Muzdalifah but their overflow. Stand wherever you wish, preferably short of Qazah toward Mina. When you overflow from Arafah's Ma'zamayn, descend anywhere right or left as you wish. I said: Descend in the slope to the mountain on my right when I come from the Ma'zamayn. He said: Yes if you wish. Preferably descend short of Qazah toward us and avoid it. I said: Preferably descend on the roadside. He said: Equal if lowered from Qazah toward us - he disliked descending on the road - saying: You constrict people. If you descend above Qazah to Arafah's Ma'zamayn overflow, no harm God willing. From Ibn Umar: The sacred Mash'ar: all of Al-Muzdalifah. From Habib: Said to Ata - meaning the stand - at Jam': Above Wadi Muhassir's belly. Said: To Qazah, and beyond that is the sacred Mash'ar. Al-Fasi: Al-Muzdalifah the place the pilgrim is ordered to descend and spend the night after departing Arafah at night, between Arafah's Ma'zamayn and Muhassir. Arafah's Ma'zamayn called the strait... Called Jam' for people's gathering, or Adam and Eve's meeting, or combining prayers, with a mosque around Qazah, small square not tall walls. Yaqut: Jam' opposite separation: Al-Muzdalifah, Qazah, the Mash'ar, named Jam' for people's gathering. Ibn Hurmah said: The heart greeted except remembering a night at Jam' and another favored at Al-Mahsub, and assembly of maidens as if their eyes eyes of gazelles exhausted before Rubrub. Another: Wished to see Layla at Jam' to calm his heart from what he suffers. When he saw her, fate granted Badwa, a blow to the arm of wishes. If time permits it and denies me, what sin for time? I say: Since Jam' (Al-Muzdalifah) is a ritual site of Hajj and place of worship renewed by pilgrims yearly, and scholars defined it clearly, naming it both, without disagreement, I suffice with what preceded from scholars' sayings about this ritual site, seeing no need to prolong for its Islamic and geographic fame. Yaqut: Jam' also: fortress in Wadi Musa, peace be upon him, from Sharah mountains near Al-Shawbak. Wadi Musa attributed to Musa ibn Imran, peace be upon him: a valley south of Bayt Al-Maqdis between it and Hijaz land, a good valley with much olives. I say: Wadi Musa still known by its name in that area.","Translation":"This story talks about the name Muzdalifah and reason for naming, plus describing its location and the Prophet's positions towards it, peace be upon him. Muzdalifah is one of the sacred mashairs where Maghrib and Isha prayers are combined, named for people's gathering or approaching it, as in Prophetic hadiths and Muslim scholars' opinions."},{"Place":"Jawatha","City":"Al-Ahsa","Description":"A city in Al-Ahsa, Bahrain. Al-Bukhari narrated from Ibn Abbas that the first Jumu'ah gathered after the Jumu'ah in the Prophet's mosque, peace be upon him, was in the mosque of Banu Abd Al-Qays at Jawatha in Bahrain. Ibn Hajar: Jawatha with dammah on jim, lightening waw which may be hamzah, then light tha'. His saying from Bahrain in Waki's narration a village from Bahrain's villages, and in another's from him: from villages of Abd Al-Qays, similarly for Al-Isma'ili from Muhammad ibn Abi Hafsah from Ibn Tihman. Yaqut: Jawatha with dammah, between the alifs tha' muthallathah, lengthened or shortened, improvised name: fortress of Abd Al-Qays in Bahrain, conquered by Al-Ala' ibn Al-Hadrami in Abu Bakr's days, year twelve, by force. Ibn Al-A'rabi: Jawatha city of Al-Khatt, Al-Mushqar city of Hajar. Salma bint Ka'b bint Ja'il satirizing Aws ibn Hajar: A cripple with jaws and news, with ears and heart and sight, drank water of Jawatha and Hajar, I cauterize with it Haram Aws ibn Hajar. Some recited Ju'atha with hamzah... They said: Ju'atha first place where Jumu'ah was held after Madinah. Iyadh: In Bahrain also a place called Qasr Jawatha, said: The Arabs all apostatized after the Prophet, peace be upon him, except Jawatha's people. A Muslim man called Abdullah ibn Hadhaf - while apostates in Bahrain besieged a group of Muslims in Jawatha: Convey to Abu Bakr a message and the youths of Madinah all. Is there for you to noble people sitting besieged in Jawatha. Their blood in every path sunbeams cover the viewers. We rely on the Merciful, we found victory for the reliant. Al-Ala' ibn Al-Hadrami came, rescued them, and conquered all Bahrain... Abu Tammam said: The loads vanished from your eyes as if palms laden from Jawatha's palms. Hamd Al-Jasir commented on some of what Yaqut mentioned: Ibn Al-A'rabi's saying Jawatha city of Al-Khatt incorrect, Jawatha near Hajar in Al-Ahsa oasis, Al-Khatt Al-Qatif and environs. Likewise his saying Al-Mushqar city of Hajar, known Hajar is Bahrain's city, Al-Mushqar a fortress built by Persians for protection before Islam. Al-Bakri: Jawatha with dammah on first and tha' muthallathah, on fa'ala: city in Bahrain of Abd Al-Qays. Imru' Al-Qays: We departed as if from Jawatha in the evening, high camels between load and hanging. Meaning: As if from Jawatha's merchants, for much game with them. Meant abundance of Jawatha's merchants' goods. Al-Baladhuri: When Mundhir ibn Sawa died after the Prophet's death shortly, Qays ibn Tha'labah ibn Ukabah's descendants apostatized with Al-Hutam - Shurayh ibn Dubay'ah ibn Umar ibn Mur'id one of Banu Qays ibn Tha'labah - named Al-Hutam for his saying: Night enveloped her with a driving storm. Rabi'ah's rest apostatized except Al-Jarud, Bishr ibn Amr Al-Abdi, and followers, appointing a son of Al-Nu'man ibn Mundhir called Mundhir. Al-Hutam proceeded to Rabi'ah with his, news reached Al-Ala' ibn Al-Hadrami, he marched with Muslims to Jawatha, a fortress in Bahrain. Rabi'ah attacked, he went out with Arabs and non-Arabs, fought fiercely. Muslims resorted to the fortress, enemies besieged. Then Al-Ala' went out one night, raided Rabi'ah, fought hard, killed Al-Hutam. Malik ibn Tha'labah Al-Abdi said: We left Shurayh with a wound like the edge of Yemeni striped cloak. The wound from blood: what fell on earth. We bereaved Um Ghadban her son, we broke the spear in Habtar's eye, we left Musma' sprawling, prey to hyena and eagle. Ibn Kathir in his narration of Bahrain apostates: The Prophet sent Al-Ala' ibn Al-Hadrami to its king Mundhir ibn Sawa Al-Abdi, who embraced Islam and established it justly. When Mundhir died shortly after, Bahrain apostatized, enthroned Ghurur - Mundhir ibn Al-Nu'man ibn Mundhir. Their poet: If Muhammad were a prophet he wouldn't die. No town remained steadfast except a village called Jawatha... Apostates besieged them, denied provisions till starved severely until Allah relieved. One of their nobles Al-Jarud ibn Al-Mu'alla - who migrated to the Prophet - stood addressing them: O Abd Al-Qays, I ask you about a matter, answer if you know, don't if not. They said: Ask. Said: Do you know Allah had prophets before Muhammad? Yes. Said: Know or think? Know. Said: What happened? Died. Said: Muhammad died as they died, I bear witness no god but Allah and Muhammad His messenger. They said: We too bear witness no god but Allah and Muhammad His messenger, you our best and master, remained steadfast on Islam, left the rest. Abu Bakr sent Al-Ala' ibn Al-Hadrami, nearing Bahrain Thumamah ibn Athal came in great assembly, all chiefs joined Al-Ala's army, he honored them - Al-Ala' of noble companions, knowledgeable worshippers, answered supplication - nearing apostates' armies, mustered great crowd, descended opposite. Muslims at night heard loud voices in apostates' army. Al-Ala' said: Who scouts their news? Abdullah ibn Hadhaf rose, entered, found them drunk senseless, returned informed. Al-Ala' mounted immediately with army, attacked killing greatly, few escaped, seized all wealth, great booty, killed Al-Hutam ibn Dubay'ah brother of Banu Qays ibn Tha'labah of their lords. I say: Hamd Al-Jasir spoke comprehensively of Jawatha: Its status rose for its people's haste to Islam, steadfastness when many Arabs apostatized, then Muslims' victory over apostates in the battle some poets took for boasting, while Ibn Khuradadhbah - as Hamadani describes him a Shu'ubi - mentions poetry praising a non-Arab, belittling it: What harm if (Anushad) has no day of Jawatha and day of Dhi Qar. Jawatha was a trade center caravans aimed, returning laden with dates etc., as in Imru' Al-Qays' poetry. Kathir describing camel drivers: Like the riders' drive in their loads coming from Samahij or from Jawatha. Known for palms and water abundance... It seems Jawatha's status weakened early - we find the author of Al-Manask listing pulpits in Bahrain omitting it, from third century... Not unlikely the village vanished since fourth century, as many villages in that area, despite high location on elevated rough from hills. Located north and east of the village site, but undulating sands surrounded from west, swallowed most houses of nearby Al-Kilabiyah village, unstable sands. Jawatha's site elevated relative to Al-Ahsa oasis villages, hence described by some ancients as Abd Al-Qays' fortress. Jawatha's site still known by name, east of Al-Kilabiyah village east of Al-Mubarraz city, about three hours walk from this city. I say: He mentioned visiting in Dhu Al-Qa'dah 1358 AH, saw its remaining ruins and mosque ruins, gave comprehensive description. Then visited in Rajab 1398 AH, I accompanied him, wrote description saying: Found all I saw - meaning first visit - changed. Mosque enclosed in modern building, only two old arches inside modern, surroundings planted with trees, many modern buildings around mosque, hard to guide to town site, was clear before change. It was obligatory to preserve all village ruins as were, enclose with wall protecting landmarks, till Antiquities Department conducts comprehensive study after removing accumulated sands, revealing hidden ruins, preserving, arranging, placing ample information about this historical town, making site a museum including its ruins some Islamic artifacts found in area, how many. Concluded talk with commemorative photo of our visit to its mosque and landmarks. I say: This brief summary of what Hamd Al-Jasir and others described of town Jawatha famed for its people's precedence to Islam and pride that their mosque first held Jumu'ah prayer after the Prophet's mosque, peace be upon him. A poet of them says: The third eastern mosque was ours and the pulpits and decisive speech in sermons. Days no mosque people know except in Taybah and the visited veiled. With this I suffice talk about this historical Islamic town.","Translation":"This story talks about the town of Jawatha in Al-Ahsa, Bahrain. It was the first place where Friday prayer was held after the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. Some Arab tribes apostatized after the Prophet's death, peace be upon him, but Jawatha's people remained on Islam and sought help from the Islamic army led by Al-Ala' bin Al-Hadrami to defeat apostates. Jawatha is also famous for its commercial importance and strategic location between caravans and trade."},{"Place":"Al-Judi","City":"Southeast Turkey, near the Iraqi border","Description":"A mountain overlooking Al-Jazirah in Iraq, from Mosul's districts. Allah Almighty said: 'And the matter was decreed, and it rested on Al-Judi, and it was said: Away with the wrongdoing people' (Surah Hud, verse 44). Al-Bukhari in his Sahih from Mujahid: Al-Judi a mountain in Al-Jazirah. Ibn Hajar: Mujahid said: Al-Judi a mountain in Al-Jazirah, connected by Ibn Abi Hatim from Ibn Abi Nujayh from him, added the mountains exalted on drowning day and it humbled so not drowned, Noah's ark rested upon it, peace be upon him. Ibn Jarir: His saying: 'And it rested on Al-Judi', Allah preserved it for us in the valley of Al-Jazirah land as a sign and lesson. From Ad-Dahhak: 'And it rested on Al-Judi' is Mosul's mountain. Yaqut: Al-Judi with tashdid on ya', mountain overlooking Ibn Umar island east of Tigris, from Mosul's districts, upon it Noah's ark rested, peace be upon him. Ibn Battutah in describing his way from Mosul to Nisibin: We traveled from Mosul, descended a village known as Ayn Ar-Rasad on a river with built bridge and large khan, then traveled descended Al-Muwaylihah village, then from it descended Ibn Umar island, large beautiful city surrounded by valley, hence named island, mostly ruined, good old market built with stones firm work, its wall also built with stones. Its people virtuous loving strangers. Day we descended it we saw Mount Al-Judi mentioned in Allah's book - exalted - where Noah's ark rested, peace be upon him, high elongated mountain. Then traveled two stages reached Nisibin city. Al-Mas'udi: Their boarding - meaning Noah and those with him - the ship Friday nineteen nights passed from Adhar, Noah and those with him stayed on water back while all earth drowned five months, then Allah commanded earth swallow water, sky withhold, ark rested on Al-Judi, mountain in Basuri land, Ibn Umar island in Mosul land between it and Tigris eight farsakhs, ark's resting place on this mountain's top to this end. Noah descended the ship with his three sons: Sam, Ham, Yafith, their wives, forty men forty women, went to mountain foot built city named Thamanin, its name to our time year 332, offspring of these eighty perished, Allah made creation's progeny from Noah from his three sons. Allah informed that saying: 'And We made his progeny the survivors' (Surah As-Saffat, verse 77). Ibn Kathir: Allah mentioned Al-Judi specifically in His book, great mountain east of Ibn Umar island beside Tigris at Mosul, extending south to north three days journey, height half day journey, green with oak trees, beside it village called Thamanin village for dwelling of those saved in the ship with Noah, peace be upon him. Ibn Al-Athir: Ibn Abbas said: The ship - Noah's - circled all earth not settling till came to the Haram without entering, circled the Haram a week, then went in earth carrying them till ended at Al-Judi, mountain at Qurdi in Mosul land settled upon it, then said: 'Away with the people' (Surah Hud, verse 44). I say: This is Mount Al-Judi upon which Noah's ark rested, peace be upon him, as came in the Noble Quran. It is in northern Iraq, Mosul area, overlooking Ibn Umar island. I exhausted talk about Ibn Umar island in the entry Al-Jazirah, historians agreed in describing and determining it. Yaqut: Al-Judi also: mountain at Aja one of Tayy mountains, meant by Abu Sa'tarah Al-Bulani: A drop from love of cloud tossed on sides of Al-Judi and night dark. When the thief settled it, north breathed to its upper water so it cold. Sweeter than her mouth and I didn't taste it but I in what the eye sees knight. I say: Al-Judi also, mentioned by Ibn Al-Athir in events of year (602): Shahab Ad-Din Muhammad ibn Sam Al-Ghuri, Ghaznah's owner, defeated by Khata infidels... News spread in his lands he was missing from battle, his companions unaware. When news spread, corrupt rose in borders, among them Daniyal owner of Mount Al-Judi, had embraced Islam, when news reached apostatized, followed Banu Kukar. Banu Kukar among rebels against him, dwellings in mountains between Hawur and Multan fortified impregnable, had obeyed Shahab Ad-Din, paid tribute. When his absence reached gathered tribes and clans, obeyed by owner of Mount Al-Judi and other dwellers in those mountains, blocked road from Lahore and others to Ghaznah. Shahab Ad-Din prepared to invade Khata infidels and Banu Kukar: Came to him - Shahab Ad-Din - news Ibn Kukar descended with armies between Jilm and Sudrah, hastened to him, surprised before expected time, fought fiercely... from morning to afternoon, fighting intensified, while fighting Qutb Ad-Din Aybak came with armies, called with Islam slogan, charged sincerely, Kukariyah and joined defeated, killed everywhere. Their families and wealth with them not left, Muslims gained unprecedented, Ibn Kukar fled after brothers and family killed. As for Ibn Daniyal owner of Mount Al-Judi came night to Qutb Ad-Din Aybak sought refuge, he sheltered interceded to Shahab Ad-Din who pardoned, took Al-Judi fortress. This is Mount Al-Judi between Ghaznah and India. Al-Judi also - mountain mentioned by Hamd Al-Jasir: Al-Judi mountain near Judah spring, mentioned in Gulf Guide on Al-Ahsa mountains, twelve miles west of Tuff mountains, Judah wells between it and them. Some said branches of Al-Furuq valleys descend from Mount Al-Judi and nearby elevations. Al-Judi also road between Najd and Al-Ahsa, relative to Judah pre-Islamic spring in Arabs' poetry and news, but later dropped ya' from beginning, pre-Islamic Yajudah, owner of Buldan dictionary said: In Banu Tamim land, about midway between Ad-Dahna and Al-Ahsa but distance between Al-Ahsa and Judah closer.","Translation":"This story talks about Mount Judi in Iraq, where Noah's ark rested as mentioned in the Holy Quran.

Most numerous people, longest land, but towns few, most land deserts for water scarcity and rain lack, food wheat and millet, have bananas grapes pomegranates, clothing hides and cotton.

Said: By Allah what we know and our prophet ordered us, peace be upon him, whatever be. When came Najashi called bishops spread scrolls around asked: What this religion you left your people, not entered my religion nor any these nations? Ja'far ibn Abi Talib spoke: O king, we were people of ignorance worshiping idols, eating carrion, committing obscenities, cutting ties, bad neighboring, strong eat weak, on that till Allah sent us messenger from us, know his lineage truthfulness trustworthiness chastity, called to Allah acknowledge worship Him, abandon what we and fathers worshiped besides Him of stones idols, ordered truth speech, fulfill trust, join ties, good neighboring, refrain from forbidden bloods, forbade obscenities, false speech, eating orphan wealth, slandering chaste women, ordered worship Allah alone no partner, prayer zakah fasting... enumerated Islam matters, believed him followed what brought from Allah, worshiped Allah alone no partner, forbade what forbade us, permitted what permitted. Our people transgressed tortured tried us from religion return to idols worship from Allah worship, permit what permitted of evils. When oppressed wronged constricted came between us religion, went to your land chose you over others, desired your neighborhood, hoped not wronged with you O king. Najashi said: Have with you what he brought from Allah? Ja'far said yes. Najashi: Read it to me.. Recited beginning of (Kaf Ha Ya 'Ayn Sad) [Surah Maryam, verse 1], Najashi wept till wetted beard, bishops wept till wetted scrolls hearing recited, Najashi said: This and what Jesus brought exit from one niche, go, by Allah won't deliver them to you, not approached. Ibn Ishaq spoke of Najashi's Islam and prayer upon him: Habashah gathered said to Najashi you left our religion, went out against him. Sent to Ja'far and companions prepared ships said board, be as are, if defeated proceed where wish, if victorious stay. Took paper wrote: He bears witness no god but Allah Muhammad His servant messenger, bears witness Jesus son Mary His servant messenger spirit word cast to Mary. Placed in his gown at right shoulder, went out to Habashah lined for him. Said O Habashah, am I not most rightful over you? Yes. Said: How saw my conduct among you? Best conduct. Said: What wrong you? Said left our religion claimed Jesus servant. Said: What you say about Jesus? Said son of Allah. Najashi placed hand on chest over gown: He bears witness Jesus son Mary added nothing over this. They accepted departed. Reached the Prophet, peace be upon him, when Najashi died prayed sought forgiveness. Al-Bukhari narrated from Abu Hurayrah the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, announced Najashi's death day he died, went to prayer place lined them prayed four takbirs. I say: This some came in Sira about Al-Habashah lands site description kings companions' migration to it, king's reception, Najashi's Islam, Prophet's prayer upon him, peace be upon him. As for this era, Al-Habashah has established state on its land known among African states, its fame dispenses talk about it.","Translation":"This story talks about Abyssinia's lands, a vast kingdom including areas like Najran and Zabid. Early Muslims migrated to Abyssinia seeking safety and freedom to practice religion. Abyssinia's king, Al-Najashi, was known for protecting them and supporting Islam. He died after the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and Muslims in Medina were informed of his death, standing at the Prophet's Mosque praying funeral prayer for the absent, indicating the deep relation between Muslims and Abyssinia."},{"Place":"Al-Hijaz","City":"Makkah Al-Mukarramah","Description":"Known region of Arabian peninsula regions. Al-Bukhari narrated from Anas: Uthman copied mushafs sent to horizons. Abdullah ibn Umar Yahya ibn Sa'id Malik saw that permissible. Some Hijaz people argued for transmission with the Prophet's hadith, peace be upon him, wrote for sariyah leader letter said don't read till reach such place, when reached read to people informed Prophet's order, peace be upon him. Al-Bakri: Arabian island they divided into five parts: Tihamah Al-Hijaz Najd Al-Arud Al-Yaman. Meaning Tihamah and ghor one, meaning Hijaz and sitting one, as Zubayr ibn Bakkar from uncle. Sarawat mountain limit between Tihamah and Najd. For greatest Arabs mountains, came from Yemen bottom till Sham deserts edges, Arabs named Hijaz, valleys cut it. Zubayr ibn Bakkar: Asked Sulayman ibn Ayash Al-Sa'di: Why named Hijaz Hijaz? Said: For separated Tihamah and Najd. Yaqut: Al-Hijaz with kasrah, ending zay. Abu Bakr Al-Anbari: In Al-Hijaz two ways: possible taken from Arabs saying man hujiza his camel hujz if tied with tie binds it, rope called hijaz, possible named Hijaz for surrounded by mountains. Al-Asma'i: Al-Hijaz from Sana'a borders to Sham borders, named Hijaz for separated between Tihamah and Najd. Then Yaqut mentioned many differing sayings in defining Al-Hijaz determining it then said best these sayings all most eloquent precise saying Abu Al-Mundhir Hisham ibn Abi An-Nadr Al-Kalbi, said in book Arabs' divergence defined Arabian island then said: Arabs lands this island they dwelt bred in divided into five parts in their poetry news: Tihamah Al-Hijaz Najd Al-Arud Al-Yaman. For Sarawat mountain greatest most mentioned Arabs mountains, came from Yemen bottom till Sham deserts edges, Arabs named Hijaz for separated ghor Tihamah behind that mountain ghor Tihamah, what below that mountain east deserts Najd to Iraq edges Al-Samawah adjoining Najd, mountain itself its Sarawat Al-Hijaz. Arab poets much mentioned Al-Hijaz followed by moderns, quote little from much, of longing yearning. Some Bedouin said: Lengthened my night in Iraq not was with me in Hijaz flanks lengthened. Would I to Hijaz land and its people with consequence before passing way. If no messenger between me you then east wind from me to you messenger. Another Bedouin: The lightning traveled from Hijaz land aroused me every Hijazi lightning arouser. O my liver from what I meet of passion if longs a companion or flashes lightning. Another: Enough sorrow I in Baghdad dweller my heart in Hijaz flanks hostage. If Hijaz mention arouses me to who in Hijaz flanks longing. By Allah didn't leave them hating them but what destines so will be. Al-Ashja' ibn Amr Al-Sulami: In Hijaz flanks buried passion arouses me when eyes quiet. I long to Hijaz and dwellers longing of separated from companion. I cry when every eye sleeps crying between its sigh groan. I pass on the camel's doctor distant empty with passion nearest far. If the passion distant and distanced from him in distance the passion sorrows appear. Excuse whom you see weeping stranger from his loved grieving. The infatuated dies with concealment if good remembrance and longing. Eh. I say: Sayings multiplied in determining Al-Hijaz all - despite difference - not far from Sarawat mountains chains known this era by this name - known also as Al-Hijaz - shortened what scholars said in determining describing Al-Hijaz in what preceded what they said indicates name Al-Hijaz includes all Sarawat mountains chains extending from Yemen extreme north parallel Red Sea coast to its end in Sham lands.","Translation":"This story talks about determining and clarifying the Hijaz region in Islamic history. Hijaz, with kasr ha', is a known province of the Arabian Peninsula, including Sarawat mountain chain extending from Yemen north to Wadi Al-Sham's edges. Scholars' opinions differed on defining Hijaz, but agreed it includes that mountain chain separating Tihama and Najd."},{"Place":"Al-Hijr (Dwellings of Thamud)","City":"Al-Ula","Description":"Dwellings of Thamud people of Salih. Allah Almighty said: 'And the companions of Al-Hijr denied the messengers (80) And We gave them Our signs, but they were turning away from them (81)' (Surah Al-Hijr, verses 80-81). Ibn Jarir: Al-Hijr Thamud's city. Narrated from Qatadah: Companions of Al-Hijr, said companions of the valley. From Abdullah ibn Umar: We passed with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, on Al-Hijr, the Messenger said: 'Do not enter the dwellings of those who wronged themselves except weeping, lest befall you like what befell them', then urged hastened till left it. From Jaber ibn Abdullah: The Messenger said while at Al-Hijr: These Salih's people Allah destroyed except a man in Allah's sanctuary protected by Allah's sanctuary from Allah's punishment. Said: O Messenger who? Said: Abu Righal. He says exalted: And Thamud their brother Salih (73) (Surah Al-A'raf, verse 73). And: 'And they used to carve from the mountains houses, feeling secure (82)' (Surah Al-Hijr, verse 82) from Allah's punishment, or secure from ruin their carved houses from mountains, or secure from death. His saying: 'So the shriek seized them at morning (83)' (Surah Al-Hijr, verse 83), says: Shout of destruction seized them when morning of fourth day from day promised punishment, told: Enjoy in your home three days. Al-Bukhari narrated from Ibn Umar when descended Al-Hijr in Tabuk expedition ordered not drink its well nor draw from it. Said already kneaded from it drawn. Ordered throw that dough pour that water. Ibn Hajar: Allah said: 'And to Thamud [We sent] their brother Salih' (Surah Al-A'raf, verse 73). And: 'And the companions of Al-Hijr had denied the messengers' (Surah Al-Hijr, verse 80). Their dwellings at Al-Hijr between Tabuk and Al-Hijaz. Ibn Kathir: Imam Ahmad in chain from Ibn Umar: When the Messenger descended with people on Tabuk descended them Al-Hijr at Thamud houses, people drew from wells Thamud drank kneaded set pots. Messenger ordered pour pots feed dough camels, moved them till descended on well camel drank, forbade enter on punished people: 'I fear befall you like befell them so don't enter upon them'. Mentioned Thamud people's long ages, built houses from mud, ruined before one's death, carved houses from mountains. Yaqut: Al-Hijr name of Thamud dwellings in Wadi Al-Qura between Madinah and Sham. Al-Istakhri: Al-Hijr small village few dwellers, from Wadi Al-Qura a day between mountains, Thamud dwellings there. Allah said: 'And you carve from the mountains houses skillfully' (Surah Ash-Shu'ara, verse 149). Said: Saw them houses like our houses in mountain folds, mountains called Al-Athalith, if viewer sees from afar thinks connected, when midst sees each piece separate itself, circumambulator circles each, around it sand hardly ascend, each piece standing itself, none ascends except with severe hardship, Thamud's well there Allah said about it and camel: 'For her a drink, and for you a drink of a known day' (Surah Ash-Shu'ara, verse 155). Jameel said: I say to caller of love with Al-Hijr between us and Wadi Al-Qura labbayk for what called. Distance separating us didn't bring forgetfulness nor long togetherness aversion. Al-Himyari: Al-Hijr Thamud town between Sham and Al-Hijaz, said from Wadi Al-Qura fortified between mountains, rock-hewn houses, now Thamud's well, surrounds Al-Hijr from every side mountains sands hardly one ascends peaks except after effort hardship, from Al-Hijr to Tayma' four stages. Al-Hijr mentioned in Quran His saying: 'And the companions of Al-Hijr denied the messengers' (Surah Al-Hijr, verse 80). The Prophet passed it en route to Tabuk ordered companions hasten, not draw from its well, said don't enter dwellings wronged except weeping. Their prophet Salih, peace be upon him, houses remaining carved in mountains, graves remaining traces evident, between Sham and Al-Hijaz. Al-Bakri: Al-Hijr with kasrah on first, mentioned in revelation Thamud town between Sham and Al-Hijaz. When the Messenger descended Al-Hijr in Tabuk expedition, people drew its well. When departed said don't drink its water nor ablute for prayer nor anyone go out tonight except with companion. People did except two from Banu Sa'idah one went for need choked on his way, Prophet prayed cured. Other went seeking camel, wind carried threw at Tayy mountains, Tayy gifted to the Messenger when came Madinah. Hamd Al-Jasir wrote research titled: (Al-Hijr is not Madain Salih) saying: People now call Madain Salih the valley north Madinah Al-Ula known as Al-Hijr - with kasrah on muhmal ha' sukun on jim ra' - with ruins researchers studied amply. Fact calling that name on this valley error people fell into since old time. Clarification: (A) Al-Hijr the valley mentioned in Noble Quran, forbade drinking its water except camel's well known till recent, this valley dwellings people Allah angered destroyed before Islam emergence by unknown eras. This valley still known Al-Hijr name with its area dwellers and others, no disagreement. (B) South Madinah Al-Ula about 55 km ancient urban ruins from building foundations water courses agriculture traces, now called strange name (Al-Mabiyat) plural (Mabiyah) with fathah on mim alif muwahhad ba' kasrah ya' tashdid ha'. This name recent, place seventh Hijri century and near known as Madinat Salih then Madain Salih. Had before another name likely (Ar-Rahbah) mentioned in many travel books places dictionaries, forgotten Ar-Rahbah name and Madinat Salih or Madain Salih name - known as Wadi Al-Atas as in Ibn Battutah's journey passed this place thirties eighth century, though valley known Wadi Ad-Daydan, find in non-Arabic books Arabized strange forms (Dadan) (Dadan) (Daydan). (C) Wadi Ad-Daydan where Madinat Salih known as Madain Salih not connected adjacency with Wadi Al-Hijr scholars recently decided uninhabitable, separates distance land about fifty km even more. (D) How error arose Al-Hijr Thamud dwellings disbelieved so Allah destroyed saved Salih believers with him, news in Quran surahs including (Surah Al-Hijr), Allah said: 'And the companions of Al-Hijr denied the messengers (80) And We gave them Our signs, but they were turning away from them (81) And they used to carve from the mountains houses, feeling secure (82) So the shriek seized them at morning (83)'. Their traces remained in carved houses mountains, dug wells valley others. Travelers from Hijaz to Sham or passing these areas saw those traces, transmitted news from books or narrators. Many news narrators recorders not commit accuracy seek truth in transmit or write, confusion occurred between ruins south Al-Ula in Wadi Al-Hijr ancient and ruins north Al-Ula from early Islam, aided confusion latter place known Madinat Salih Muslim man from Banu Al-Abbas town existing till fourth Hijri, former Hijr dwellers known as Salih's people, one wells known as well of Salih's she-camel, place one mountains known as Salih's mosque i.e. place worshiped. Hence mistakenly called Al-Hijr Madain Salih. Oldest I saw doing Turkish author name (Bahjat Al-Manazil) or (Nahjat Al-Manazil) author Muhammad Adib Al-Mawqi Al-Rumi, as in (Idah Al-Maknun) quoted from his book Al-Hijr known as Madain Salih or Salih villages or Adal, dwellings in Madain Salih carved in rock, none dwells them. First confusion between places describing south Al-Ula with Al-Hijr pages oldest text I viewed in Andalusian Al-Balawi's journey... Hajj year 738 AH coming from Sham with Kark pilgrims. Eh. I say: Hamd Al-Jasir quoted Al-Balawi's talk fully then texts from scholars' sayings and travelers spoke of these two places, our place doesn't accommodate mention. Eh. Objected one reader denying what said distinguishing between Al-Hijr and Madain Salih, Hamd Al-Jasir replied, in reply: I spoke clarifying calling Madain Salih on Al-Hijr site not known to ancient scholars whose works reached us, clarified Madain Salih name not applied to Wadi Al-Hijr except later eras, application arose from illusion clarified in what wrote. Came one brothers commentators saying (Not strange called Al-Hijr Madain Salih, Thamud homeland, sent to them Salih messenger from Allah, midst in lineage best in place, Allah made for them sign Allah's she-camel all that happened in Madain Salih now known Al-Hijr). Said before: Fact Madain Salih Al-Hijr relative to Allah's messenger Salih peace be upon him. Who denied Al-Hijr Thamud homeland called now Madain Salih? Rather who denied Salih peace be upon him prophet to Thamud till our brother guides to this grievous error? Question who can prove one ancient scholars applied to Al-Hijr Madain Salih? Who can with historical evidences prove brother's saying (All that happened in Madain Salih)? While decisive texts indicate happened in Al-Hijr. Before researchers countless books interpretation history place determination many mention Thamud dwelling Al-Hijr sending Salih peace be upon him to them, but do they have this Al-Hijr Madain Salih? Al-Hijr lands people wronged themselves Allah destroyed by decisive text in Noble Quran prophetic Sunnah, Salih peace be upon him not proper described what described. Allah saved him believers with from quake befell those people {So they became in their home fallen prone (78)} [Surah Al-A'raf, verse 78]. If resided those lands would befall him what befell, the Messenger ordered hasten passing those abodes fearing befall like befell dwellers. I say: This some Hamd Al-Jasir said replying denying his saying differing between Al-Hijr and Madain Salih. Abd Al-Quddus Al-Ansari spoke of Al-Hijr in research titled Al-Hijr or Madain Salih, mentioned Red Sea club in Jeddah conducted trip to Madain Salih mid 1384 AH, members returned to Jeddah, some spoke results trip what saw immortal ruins, some wrote in local papers views based observation reading, mentioned Madain Salih carvings not dwellings for living inhabitants but dwellings for their dead, i.e. graves burials tombs. Relied proving theory on narrowness carved houses, what some Orientalist travelers who saw before wrote about. This view not taken for what we reviewed this view not taken for what we reviewed interpretations history geography ancient Islamic Arabic books... Source first last Orientalists group, who followed their path from Arab authors after in modern era. Embraced this doctrine some who wrote in local papers from Red Sea club Jeddah trip to Madain Salih. Spoke to me some asserting carvings but graves for Salih's people.. impossible their dwellings for severe narrowness, caves caverns, existence dead bones... Said narrow houses not always indicate unsuitability for dwelling... here we see in crowded lands today how many persons dwell one room.. each has what suffices sleep body. Because origin this theory imported from Orientalists as mentioned earlier, see upon us always take Orientalists information cautiously, especially concerning our religion language ruins lands.. from two aspects not one. First their understandings sometimes twisted dominated by environments nature veer from clear right by nature to blatant error... Second hidden purpose naturally traditionally in many's bosoms, our duty today - risen from long slumber - not rely their scientific efforts alone.. but strive ourselves uncover our civilization treasures scientifically intellectually verbally artifactually news-wise. Muslim historians travelers scholars saw houses quarried in mountain or mountains Madain Salih inhabited by living Thamudis who quarried.. thereby interpreted His saying exalted: 'So those their houses desolate for what they wronged' (Surah An-Naml, verse 52), thereby interpreted other noble verse: 'And remember when He made you successors after 'Ad and settled you in the land, [and] you take for yourselves palaces from its plains and carve from the mountains, homes' (Surah Al-A'raf, verse 74). Emptiness i.e. void from them after destruction glaring evidence their dwelling in life eh. Abd Al-Quddus Al-Ansari mentioned in this research many texts from Muslim historians' sayings Orientalists' sayings our place doesn't accommodate mention. In book issued by Antiquities Museums Department in Ministry Education Kingdom Saudi Arabia titled: (Introduction to Kingdom Saudi Arabia Ruins): Madain Salih located 15 km north Al-Ula. Came in Noble Quran name (Al-Hijr) as Thamud capital people of Allah's prophet Salih, area includes several caves graves carved in close sandy mountains, these caves as inscriptions indicate graves for many peoples who ruled area from Nabataeans Romans Arabs, resemble greatly graves (Petra) ancient Nabataeans capital now in Jordan, on graves facades statues images mythical heads pagan carving back second century BC, near graves area ancient settlements perhaps dwellings Madain Salih dwellers in different eras, famed with Greek Roman historians Hijr had port named it (Al-Wajh currently) considered important trade artery. Appears from diversity Al-Hijr ruins arts various beginning life prosperity area back thousands years, remained long time receiving east trade coming via southern Arabian ports exporting west via Syria ports north, inferred from studying scattered ruins in area around dense peoples gathered lived several centuries. I say: Noticeable this report contained assertion carved dwellings in sandy mountains Al-Hijr area but graves peoples many who ruled area from Nabataeans Romans Arabs, didn't contain anything Quranic verses speaking this land people prophet Salih what befell, though some noble Quranic verses understood these carved houses dwellings for living, preceded in this research some verses contained that. Rather asserted these carved houses not exclusive to Thamud, graves for many peoples Nabataeans Romans Arabs Quran verses explicit attributing carving these houses to Thamud people Salih. Atiq Al-Biladi spoke of Al-Hijr lands in two places dictionary, mentioned name Wadi Al-Hijr once, Madain Salih another, said in talk Wadi Al-Hijr known: Still name flows into Wadi Al-Ula (Al-Qura) from north.. Now connected paved road to Madinah, was linked by now suspended railway, 345 km north Madinah, about 24 km from Al-Ula, known as Madain Salih with wondrous wells.. Head Wadi Al-Qura now known Wadi Al-Ula. Madain Salih town north Hijaz with archaeological touristic tint, dwellers Thamud people Salih, Allah sent Salih disobeyed Allah destroyed with fitnah, news detailed in Quran.. Wondrous ruins, houses carved rock, water stores in rock, mountains prominent, most separate others, as if planted ground.. People called these dwellings Madain Salih choosing Salih's name peace be upon him aversion from Thamud disbelievers name, thus became known only Madain Salih. I say: His saying thus became known only Madain Salih contradicts saying at beginning talk Wadi Al-Hijr known, still name. Fact these lands still known ancient name Al-Hijr, called this era Madain Salih.","Translation":"The story discusses the difference between \"Al-Hijr\" and \"Madain Saleh.\" It indicates common confusion between them, where \"Madain Saleh\" is mistakenly thought the same as \"Al-Hijr,\" but there are differences. The text clarifies \"Al-Hijr\" is known today as \"Wadi Al-Hijr,\" containing ancient ruins indicating Thamud people carving rock houses. \"Madain Saleh\" is an archaeological area known for wondrous wells and forts, emphasizing distinguishing between archaeological and historical places correctly."},{"Place":"Al-Hijr","City":"Riyadh (Najd)","Description":"Arram said describing Ar-Rahdhiyah village for Ansar and Banu Salim from Najd, wells much cultivation palms.

Al-Bukhari narrated from Abdullah ibn Abbas: The Prophet, peace be upon him, departed Madinah after combing oiled wore izaar and rida' his companions. Said arrived Makkah four nights into Dhu Al-Hijjah circumambulated House sa'i between Safa Marwah not exit due to his sacrificial animal garlanded then descended upper Makkah at Al-Hujun. From Abdullah mawla Asma' bint Abi Bakr heard Asma' say whenever passed Al-Hujun: Allah bless Muhammad we descended with him here we then light little mounts little provisions I my sister Aisha performed Umrah. Ibn Hajar: Kada' fathah kaf mad, this pass descends to Al-Mu'alla Makkah dwellers cemetery, called (Al-Hujun) fathah muhmal ha' dammah jim.

Dwelt Al-Jaz' Jaz' between Abi Musa to palms from Safi As-Sabab. People abode traded for death no blame on time after them. Departed me knew certainly no return for who tasted death. Abu Al-Walid: Makkah people buried dead in valley sides right left in Jahiliyyah early Islam. All turned graves to left ravine for narration came in it, Prophet's saying, peace be upon him: Good ravine good cemetery. Al-Waqidi in Umarah Al-Qadiyyah narration: The Messenger and companions exited mercy upon them and Allah's messenger on his mount Al-Qaswa companions surrounding the Messenger swords girded making talbiyah. When reached Dhi Tuwa stopped on his mount Al-Qaswa Muslims around, entered from pass overlooks Al-Hujun on his mount Al-Qaswa Ibn Rawahah holding rein his mount. In narration Makkah entry conquest day: Sa'd entered with banner till planted at Al-Hujun... Az-Zubayr ibn Al-Awwam came with Muslims till ended at Al-Hujun planted flag at the Messenger's dwelling, peace be upon him. Abdullah ibn Zayd from Abi Ja'far: Abu Rabi' pitched for the Messenger dome at Al-Hujun of leather, the Messenger came till the dome with Umm Salamah and Maymunah. From Abu Rabi': Said to the Prophet: Won't descend your home in the ravine? Said: Did Aqil leave us home? Aqil sold the Messenger's home and brothers men women in Makkah. Said to his messenger: Descend in... the Prophet said: Don't enter houses. Remained restless at Al-Hujun not entered house, came to mosque from Al-Hujun. From Ata: When the Messenger migrated to Madinah didn't enter Makkah houses, restless in Al-Abtah in Umarah Al-Qadiyyah conquest year his Hajj. From Muhammad ibn Jubayr ibn Mut'im from father from grandfather: Saw the Messenger restless at Al-Hujun conquest came for every prayer. Ibn Jubayr in journey: It - meaning Makkah - three doors: first at Al-Mu'alla from it exit to blessed cemetery at place known Al-Hujun, left of going to it mountain top sign like tower, exit from it to Umrah road that pass known Kada', meant by Hassan in poem dust raises their appointment Kada'. The Prophet said conquest day: Enter whence Hassan said. Entered from that pass, this place known Al-Hujun, meant by Al-Harith ibn Mudadd Al-Jurhumi: As if between Al-Hujun to As-Safa no intimate nor night talker in Makkah talked. Yes we its people destroyed us turns nights and destructive fortunes. At mentioned cemetery burial many companions followers saints righteous, their sites worn people land names gone... Right if face mentioned cemetery mosque mile between two mountains, said: Mosque where the jinn pledged to the Prophet, peace be upon him. Ibn Battutah mentioned in journey similar what Ibn Jubayr mentioned added. Said: Al-Hujun mountain overlooking cemetery, from it Al-Mahsub i.e. Al-Abtah. Next cemetery. Al-Bakri: Al-Hujun fathah first on fa'ul: place at Makkah at Al-Mahsab, mountain overlooking opposite mosque follows Shu'ab Al-Jazzarin between two basins in Awf wall. Nusayb said: Don't forget you as long Thabir fixed its place as long dweller for Al-Hujun Al-Mahsab. Zubayr: Al-Hujun Makkah people's cemetery.

Yes we its people destroyed us turns nights and destructive fortunes. I say: These preceding sayings agreed determining Al-Hujun position describing except what Al-Suhayli and Al-Sukri said describing distance between it and Makkah that not based on evidence nor agree natural reality this place, as saw scholars determined Al-Hujun: sometimes proximity to Al-Mahsab sometimes attribution to Al-Mu'alla cemetery sometimes proximity to Bay'ah mosque, all said upper Makkah these sayings all correct Al-Hujun still known name unchanged, Al-Mu'alla cemetery still known, Bay'ah mosque still thriving known, sayings indicated Al-Hujun name for pass penetrates from Al-Mahsab to Dhi Tuwa, name for mountain overlooking at its end.

Al-Fasi spoke of Al-Hujun said: Al-Hujun mountain at Al-Mu'allah Makkah people's cemetery then mentioned many differing sayings didn't come end to saying gathers these differing sayings hence sufficed describing determining this place with what preceded especially this place known name over years famous in Makkah unchanged.","Translation":"This story talks about Al-Hajun, a mountain at upper Mecca at Mecca's people's cemetery, also known as Al-Thaniyah Al-Ulya and Kada'.

Al-Bukhari narrated from Zayd ibn Khalid Al-Juhani: The Messenger led us Fajr at Al-Hudaybiyah after rain that night. When finished turned to people said: Do you know what your Lord said? Said: Allah His messenger know best. Said: Morning among My servants believer in Me disbeliever, who said rained by Allah's grace mercy believer in Me disbeliever in star, who said by such star's setting disbeliever in Me believer in star. Al-Waqidi narrated from Al-Miswar ibn Makhrama: Marched the Messenger - meaning Al-Hudaybiyah expedition - when neared Al-Hudaybiyah knee of his mount fell on people's dung pass. Mount kneeled people said: Halt halt, refused rise said: Al-Qaswa obstinated. Messenger said: Didn't obstinate not her habit, but elephant's detainer detained. By Allah don't ask me today matter magnifying Allah's sanctity except gave them. Urged rose, turned back beginning till descended people on well from Al-Hudaybiyah wells scant water sipped sip, people complained to Messenger water scarcity, drew arrow from quiver ordered inserted in well, gushed pure till departed satiated. They and who descended arrow Najiyah ibn Al-A'jam from Aslam. Narration: Who descended arrow Najiyah ibn Judhab. Narration: Najiyah ibn Al-A'jam narrated called him Messenger when complained water scarcity, took arrow from quiver handed to called me with bucket well water, came performed ablution, rinsed mouth spat in bucket people severe heat only one well, infidels preceded Baldah overcame its waters. Said: Descend with water pour in well stir its water with arrow. Did, by who sent him truth didn't exit till almost submerged me, boiled like pot boiling till filled leveled edges, scoop water side till satiated last. Arram: Circles Shumnusir - mountain - from villages: large village called Rahat in valley called Gharan, recited: If Gharana us valley bottom we love its dweller covenant upon me firm. West village called Al-Hudaybiyah not large, opposite hill called Da'adhi', near large dam collects water, dam gathered stones placed some on some. Poet said: Indeed annihilation toward Da'adhi' dam and advance my eye in gazelles long. These villages for Sa'd and Banu Masruh who the Messenger grew among, Hudhayl has some, Fahm also. Their waters at Thur, wells springs not wells. Yaqut: Al-Hudaybiyah dammah ha' fathah dal sakin ya' kasrah ba' tashdid fathah ya' ending ha'. Differed some tashdid some lighten, narrated from Al-Shafi'i - Allah pleased - correct tashdid Al-Hudaybiyah lightening Al-Ja'ranah, erred who specified lightening. Said: All correct, Madinah people thicken Iraq lighten. Medium village not large, named well there at tree mosque where the Messenger pledged under. Al-Khattabi in Amali: Named Al-Hudaybiyah for humped tree was there. Between Al-Hudaybiyah Makkah stage. Between it Madinah nine stages. In hadith: Well. Part Al-Hudaybiyah in hal part in haram, farthest hal from House, not in haram length nor width but like haram corner, hence between it mosque more day. With Malik all in haram. Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi: The Prophet performed Umrah Al-Hudaybiyah reconciled infidels after five years ten months Hijrah. Al-Waqidi: The Messenger saw dream entered House shaved head, took House key, performed Umrah with performers, rallied companions to Umrah, hastened prepared exit some months remaining Shawwal year six... Companions exited with him not doubting conquest for vision the Messenger saw entered House shaved head. Exited without weapons except swords in sheaths, some companions drove sacrifice... Umar ibn Al-Khattab said: Fear O Messenger from Abu Sufyan ibn Harb companions, not taken war preparation? Messenger said: Don't know, not like carry weapons performing Umrah. Sa'd ibn Ubadah said: O Messenger if carried weapons with us if saw suspicion from people prepared, Messenger said: Not carry weapons, exited performing Umrah. Appointed on Madinah Ibn Umm Maktum, exited Madinah Monday crescent Dhu Al-Qa'dah... Exited with him Muslims sixteen hundred, said thousand four hundred, said thousand five hundred twenty-five men. Eh. Ibn Ishaq: The Messenger exited Dhu Al-Qa'dah performing Umrah not intending war. Ibn Hisham: Appointed on Madinah Numaylah ibn Abdullah Al-Laythi... Messenger exited with emigrants Ansar joined from Arabs, drove sacrifice, entered ihram Umrah people feel safe from war, know exited visitor House magnifier not intending fight. Jaber ibn Abdullah said: We Al-Hudaybiyah companions fourteen hundred. Az-Zuhri: Messenger exited till at Usfan met Bishr ibn Shayban Al-Ka'bi - Ibn Hisham said said Bisr - said: O Messenger this Quraysh heard your march, exited with them milch camels clad tigers skins, descended Dhi Tuwa swearing Allah you not enter upon them ever. This Khalid ibn Al-Walid in their cavalry advanced to Kura' Al-Ghamim. Messenger said: Woe Quraysh war consumed them what harm if left me rest Arabs, if hit me what they want, if Allah grants me victory enter Islam intact, if not fight with strength. What think Quraysh, by Allah not cease striving on what Allah sent me till manifests or this nape separates. Took road exits on Thaniyyat Al-Murar descent Al-Hudaybiyah below Makkah. Called Umar ibn Al-Khattab send to Makkah convey to Quraysh nobles what came for, Umar said O Messenger fear Quraysh on myself, none Banu Adi ibn Ka'b in Makkah protect me, Quraysh knew my enmity severity, but guide you to man dearer there than me, Uthman ibn Affan. Messenger called Uthman ibn Affan, sent to Abu Sufyan Quraysh nobles, inform not come war, only came visitor House magnifier its sanctity. Ibn Ishaq: Uthman went to Makkah, met Aban ibn Sa'id ibn Al-As entering or before entering, carried before him, protected till conveyed message the Messenger, peace be upon him. Uthman went to Abu Sufyan Quraysh greats, conveyed from the Messenger what sent. Said to Uthman when finished message the Messenger: If wish circumambulate House circumambulate. Said: Not do till the Messenger circumambulates. Quraysh detained him, reached the Messenger Muslims Uthman ibn Affan killed. Ibn Ishaq: Told Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr when reached the Messenger Uthman killed said: Not leave till engage people, called people to pledge. Ridwan pledge under tree, people say pledged on death, Jaber ibn Abdullah say the Messenger not pledged us on death but pledged not flee. The Messenger pledged people, none Muslims present absent except Al-Jadd ibn Qays brother Banu Salamah, Jaber ibn Abdullah say by Allah as if see him clinging armpit his she-camel shrunk to it hiding from people. Then came to the Messenger what mentioned Uthman matter false. Ibn Ishaq Az-Zuhri: Then Quraysh sent Suhayl ibn Amr brother Banu Amir ibn Lu'ay to the Messenger, said to him come Muhammad reconcile, not in reconciliation except return from us this year, by Allah Arabs not speak us he entered upon us by force ever. Suhayl ibn Amr came when the Messenger saw approaching said people wanted reconciliation when sent this man. When Suhayl ended to the Messenger spoke long conversed then reconciliation proceeded. When matter settled remained but writing leaped Umar ibn Al-Khattab came Abu Bakr said O Abu Bakr isn't he Allah's messenger? Yes. Aren't we Muslims? Yes. Aren't they polytheists? Yes. Then why give lowliness our religion? Abu Bakr said O Umar stick to his stirrup, I bear witness he Allah's messenger. Umar said: I bear witness he Allah's messenger. Then came the Messenger said O Messenger aren't you Allah's messenger? Yes. Aren't we Muslims? Yes. Aren't they polytheists? Yes. Then why give lowliness our religion? Said I Allah's servant messenger, not oppose His command not waste me. Umar used say not ceased give charity fast pray free from what did that day fearing words spoke till hoped good. Then the Messenger called Ali ibn Abi Talib said write In name Allah Most Gracious Most Merciful. Suhayl said not know this but write your name O Allah. Messenger said write your name O Allah, wrote then said write this what reconciled upon Muhammad Allah's messenger Suhayl ibn Amr. Suhayl said if witnessed you Allah's messenger not fought you, but write your name father's name. Messenger said write this what reconciled upon Muhammad ibn Abdullah Suhayl ibn Amr, agreed lay war from people ten years, people safe some refrain from some, whoever came Muhammad from Quraysh without guardian permission return them, whoever came Quraysh from with Muhammad not return him, between us open chest, no stealth no betrayal, whoever wished enter Muhammad's covenant pact enter, whoever wished enter Quraysh's covenant pact enter. Khuzaymah leaped said we in Muhammad's covenant pact, Banu Bakr leaped said we in Quraysh's covenant pact. You return from us this year, not enter upon us Makkah, if next year we exit you enter with companions, stay three, with you traveler's weapon swords in sheaths not enter with other. When the Messenger finished writingwitnessed reconciliation men from polytheists men from Muslims. Ibn Ishaq Az-Zuhri: Then the Messenger departed that direction returning, till between Makkah Madinah descended Surah Al-Fath 'Indeed We have given you a clear conquest' (Surah Al-Fath, verse 1). Ibn Hisham: Told Abu Ubaydah some with the Messenger when entered Madinah said to him: Didn't say O Messenger you enter Makkah safe? Said: Yes, did I say to you from my year this? Said no, said it as Gabriel said to me. Al-Waqidi: Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri sat with Umar ibn Al-Khattab one day, mentioned Al-Qadiyyah said entered me that day doubt, reviewed the Prophet that day review not reviewed like ever, freed in what entered me that day necks fasted forever, I remember what did alone biggest concern, then Allah made Al-Qadiyyah outcome good, befits servants suspect opinion Allah not outcome what between Muhammad his Lord servants hasten Allah blessed exalted not hasten servants haste, till matters reach what Allah wanted. Companions the Messenger disliked reconciliation, exited not doubting conquest for vision the Messenger saw shaved head, entered House. When saw reconciliation entered people matter great almost perished... Al-Waqidi: The Messenger stayed Al-Hudaybiyah some ten days, said twenty nights, when departed Al-Hudaybiyah descended Marr Az-Zahran then Usfan, provisions depleted, people complained to the Messenger reached hunger - people mounts - said slaughter O Messenger oil from fats, make from hides shoes permitted. Umar ibn Al-Khattab informed came to the Messenger said O Messenger don't do if people remaining mounts better, but call them provisions then supplicate Allah in them. Messenger ordered mats spread then announcer who has remaining provision spread on mats. Abu Shurayh Al-Ka'bi said saw who comes with single date, most not come anything, comes with handful flour, handful suwayq, all little. When provisions gathered sources cut walked the Messenger to it supplicated blessing, said bring vessels, came vessels Abu Shurayh present comes man takes what wishes provision till man takes what no carrier for, then Messenger permitted departure when departed rained what wished summer. Messenger descended descended with him, drank water. This summary what scholars said describing Al-Hudaybiyah determining it, events Al-Hudaybiyah expedition, miracles happened to the Prophet there, peace be upon him. Al-Fakihi: As for Al-Hudaybiyah mosque, mosque from which the Prophet performed Umrah year reconciled Quraysh prevented entering Makkah, had with him judgments from the Prophet, peace be upon him, sunnahs practiced today. Abd Al-Malik ibn Duhaysh: Al-Hudaybiyah famous place old Jeddah road, known today Ash-Shumaysi, man bearing name dug well there called Bir Shumaysi, applied to that area: Ash-Shumaysi. Some there call well area Bir Al-Hadiyah, perhaps foreign application for Hudaybiyah word, not from haram about (1.5) from haram markers, Al-Hudaybiyah about (25) km from Sacred Mosque. In it modern mosque beside old ruined, built black stone gypsum, near more well some farms established, near mosque beautiful modern gardens for capital secretariat, before Al-Hudaybiyah mosque coming from Jeddah inspection point police affiliated prevent non-Muslims entering haram. I say: Preceded in Baldah entry more clarification - see it.","Translation":"The story talks about Al-Hudaybiyah, its location, history of its expedition, and miracles there, explaining jurists' differences on its site and scholars' different opinions. The text also mentioned the mosque known as Al-Hudaybiyah and some modern events related to it."},{"Place":"Hira'","City":"Makkah Al-Mukarramah","Description":"Known mountain in Makkah. Al-Bukhari narrated from Jaber ibn Abdullah heard the Prophet saying then revelation paused pause while walking heard voice from sky raised gaze toward sky behold angel came at Hira' sitting on chair between sky earth feared till fell ground came family said cover me cover me revealed Allah exalted: 'O you who covers himself [with a garment]' to His saying: 'And abandon [other] uncleanliness' (Surah Al-Muddaththir, verse 5). Al-Azraqi: Mount Hira' long mountain at base Shu'ab Al Khans overlooking Morish wall Morish wall called Hira' wall left going to Iraq overlooking peak opposite Thabir Ghayna' Iraq path between it and it. The Messenger came hid in it from Makkah polytheists in cave at its head facing qiblah... In Hira' poet says: Relieve her O Allah for what appeared to her Hira' like head crowned Persian. Pampered not know misery life. Phrase said and had the Messenger came hid in it from Makkah polytheists in cave at its head, seems particular to Mount Thawr not Mount Hira'. Al-Fakihi: Mount Hira' long mountain at base Shu'ab Al Khans overlooking Morish wall, Hira' wall left going to Iraq, overlooking peak opposite Thabir Ghayna' Iraq path between it and it. The Messenger worshiped at beginning prophethood in cave at its head facing qiblah. Narrated from Jaber ibn Abdullah: Told us the Messenger: I secluded in Hira' cave, mentioned long hadith. Yaqut: Hira' kasrah lightening mad mountain from Makkah mountains three miles, known, some feminize not decline, Jarir said: Aren't we noblest two burdens all and greatest them at Hira' valley fire? Not decline went by to town Hira' by. Some in it three dialects open ha' kasrah, shorten alif madd, incline not permissible inclination, ra' preceded alif madd fathah, repeated letter stood place elevated letter, like Rashid Rafi' not inclined. The Prophet before revelation came worship cave this mountain in it Gabriel came peace be upon him. Al-Bakri: Hira' kasrah first madd on fa'al mountain at Makkah. Al-Asma'i some mention decline, some feminize not decline, Awf ibn Al-Akhwas in feminizing: By who Quraysh Hajj its sanctities what gathered Hira'. Recited Farra: Aren't we noblest two burdens caravan and greatest them at Hira' valley fire. Ibn Al-Anbari: Didn't run Hira' made name around mountain, as city name, recited Ibn Hurmah in feminizing: Left Hira' from spring summer ostrich sand ample and Murqansa. Ran it for poetry necessity, Abu Hatim: Masculine in Hira' more known two faces... Ru'bah said: By lord face from Hira' bent. Al-Asma'i: Didn't see it bent, heard where bent its bender. Arram: Thabir lofty mountain, opposite Hira' lofty taller than Thabir, top towering peak slippery, mentioned the Messenger ascended its summit with group companions moved, the Messenger said to it steady Hira' upon you but prophet or truthful or martyr. I say: Hadith steady Hira' for upon you but prophet or truthful or martyr this hadith came in Mount Uhud, not in Mount Hira', preceded clarification in Uhud entry see it. Ibn Kathir: Mount Hira' has peak overlooking Ka'bah bent, cave in that bend, how good what Ru'bah ibn Al-Ajjaj said and approved: By lord corners from Hira' bent. Al-Fasi: Hira' upper Makkah for much seclusion the Prophet in it at beginning prophethood, what Allah honored with revelation descent in it upon him, revelation descent on the Prophet in Hira' in cave in it, some ways hadith till surprised truth while in Hira' cave, this cave upper Hira' rear, famous cave with people, successor transmitted from predecessor, intend visitation. Al-Azraqi mentioned this cave place said after mentioning wall overlooking peak opposite Thabir Ghayna' Iraq path between it and it had the Messenger come hid in it from Makkah polytheists in cave at its head overlooking peak facing qiblah. Al-Fakihi narrated news implies the Prophet hid in Hira' from polytheists harm, strange. Likewise what Al-Azraqi mentioned known cave the Prophet hid in from polytheists Thawr cave not Hira' cave came to it for worship Allah knows best. If authentic the Prophet's hiding in Hira' other than hiding in Thawr Allah knows best. Abu Ubaydah mentioned with some news said Hira' famous between it Makkah mile half. End. What Abu Ubaydah mentioned between Hira' Makkah mile half consideration, opposing what Matale' owner transmitted he said three miles from Makkah, others mentioned that Ibn Jubayr said in Makkah three miles. I say: Observation witnesses contrary what Abu Ubaydah mentioned amount between Hira' Makkah, correctness what Ibn Jubayr Matale' owner mentioned amount Allah knows best. Eh. I say: From preceding we see scholars agreed sayings determining Mount Hira' position in Makkah distance between it Makkah - though few scholars differed determining distance - agreed describing. But Ibn Kathir mentioned has peak overlooking Ka'bah bent cave in that bend, evidenced what Ru'bah said approved by lord corner from Hira' bent. This poetry Al-Bakri brought by lord face from Hira' bent. Narrated from Al-Asma'i said didn't see it bent, heard where bent its bender. Seems Al-Asma'i denied on Ru'bah describing Hira' corner bent, observation confirms no bent corner in Hira', but top slight tilt, not reach bent degree, not correct describe bent. Mount Hira' most famous mountains in Makkah still known name, known position as ancient scholars described, observation indicated. Also called Mount An-Nur name applied after revelation light descended in it on Muhammad peace be upon him in its cave. Scholars estimated distance between Hira' Makkah three miles, this era urban expansion took extend to it from all sides, no distance remained between it Makkah estimated.","Translation":"This story talks about Mount Hira' in Mecca, also known as Mount Al-Nur, witnessing revelation's descent on the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. The Prophet used to worship in it before revelation's start, and scholars mentioned different locations for Mount Hira', including a cave at its top overlooking the Kaaba and another at its summit. It also mentioned events indicating its existence in Mecca, like the Prophet hiding in it from polytheists and staying in Hira' for a period."},{"Place":"Al-Harrah (Western)","City":"Madinah Al-Munawwarah","Description":"Known harrah in Madinah. Al-Bukhari narrated from Anas: People from Ukl or Uraynah came found Madinah unhealthy ordered them milch camels drink their urines milks. Departed when healthy killed the Prophet's shepherd drove camels. News came early day sent after when day rose brought cut hands feet branded eyes thrown in Al-Harrah begging water not given. Ibn Hajar: Al-Harrah land with black rough stones as if burned fire known Madinah. Yaqut: Owner Kitab Al-Ayn Al-Harrah land with black rough stones as if burned fire, plural al-harat al-ahrun al-hirar al-hurun. Al-Asma'i: Al-Harrah land clothed with black stones, if elevation stones then rock, plural rocks. Yaqut: Harrah Waqim one Madinah's two harras eastern, named after Amaliq man named Waqim dwelt anciently, said Waqim name atum from Madinah atams to it attributed harrah, Al-Marrar said: At Harrah Waqim camels lop-sided see for clan skulls follow. In this harrah famous Harrah battle in Yazid ibn Mu'awiyah days year (63), army leader from Yazid Moslim ibn Uqbah Al-Murri, called for ugly deed Musrif, came Madinah descended Harrah Waqim Madinah people exited fighting him, broke them... then turned toward Makkah ill wounded died days, willed to Al-Husayn ibn Numayr. Harrah story long, was after Husayn killing - Allah pleased - stoning Ka'bah with catapult ugliest happened Yazid days, Muhammad ibn Bahrah As-Sa'idi said: If kill us day Harrah Waqim we on Islam first killed. We left you at Badr humiliated built with our swords from you transfer. If safe seeker House refuge what gained us from you even healed great. Seeker House Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr, Ubayd Allah ibn Qays Ar-Ruqayyat said: She said: If we can visit you two doctors from us knowing your ailment. But our people after our covenant committed, I knew multiples burdened your coals. Our people before that hers relatives collected glory distant wood. Cut ties shortened group returned dreams narrations after cushions. Harrah Al-Wabarah with three fathahs recorded Muslim book, some sakin ba', three miles from Madinah. Al-Majd spoke of Madinah's two harras, mentioned like Yaqut added from Ka'b Al-Ahbar we find in Allah's book exalted harrah east Madinah killed there killing their faces light resurrection day as moon full moon night said Harrah Waqim Harrah battle killing Al-Husayn - Allah pleased - stoning Ka'bah with catapult ugliest happened Yazid days. Al-Samhudi: Harrah Waqim Madinah eastern harrah, named after Amaliq man descended, from Ibn Zabalah Waqim atum Banu Abd Al-Ashhal, by named that side Waqim. Called also Harrah Banu Qurayzah for at its southern edge, Harrah Zahrah for adjacency. In it Harrah killing. Al-Samhudi: Harrah Al-Wabarah muharakah permitted some sukun muwahhadah, three miles from Madinah, so what Al-Majd said here. Al-Hijri: Uruwah farms palace in Harrah Al-Wabarah. Hence authentic Muslim from Aishah said the Messenger exited before Badr, when at Harrah Al-Wabarah man overtook mentioned daring valor... Al-Shanqiti: Eastern harrah clear ancient landmark Madinah, came in Torah migrants Banu last time, hence Jews Qaynuqa' - An-Nadir - Qurayzah dwelt awaiting him, Madinah three harras Harrah Banu Bayadah south Quba with Banu Qaynuqa' dwellings, Harrah Waqim eastern extends from Bathan till Ajmah Ash-Shaykhayn, western harrah starts end Harrah Banu Bayadah south till Banu Salamah dwellings north at Qiblatayn. Eastern harrah called Harrah Waqim name old atum in it, extends east Bqi' two hundred meters near Mahd Az-Zahab distance hundred twenty miles. Jews dwellings midst eastern harrah, fortifications natural for much treachery sowing evils igniting wars not dwell except fortified villages. Overlooks this harrah on Madinah dwellings Banu Zafar, north dwellings Banu Mu'awiyah people Masjid Al-Ijabah, east dwellings Banu Abd Al-Ashhal people Usayd ibn Hudayr, north northern edge harrah dwellings Banu Harithah harrah from there called by them Harrah Banu Harithah. Madinah historians divided this harrah five parts two regions dwelt by Jews Banu An-Nadir Jews Banu Qurayzah, three regions north dwelt by Ansar tribes Banu Zafar then Banu Abd Al-Ashhal then Banu Za'ura ibn Jusham, supports most Aws dwellings eastern side Madinah. Stroller this harrah still sees ruins atams, rubble palaces, stones villages houses, pottery pieces leaves no doubt viewers was inhabited populated. Today eastern harrah flourishing city with villas palaces gardens roads squares vital centers security health education bakeries restaurants markets fuel stations wedding halls, result security prosperity this land enjoys under Kingdom Saudi Arabia. I say: The Prophet determined Madinah haram east west these two harras, said between my labatah haram, labatah its two harras. Abd Al-Quddus Al-Ansari: Harrah Waqim eastern harrah bordering Madinah haram east, western limit Harrah Al-Wabarah, its labatah meant in hadith determined Madinah haram, mentioned dividing dwellings five parts like Al-Shanqiti mentioned likewise regarding what seen this harrah traces houses forts atams etc ancient urbanization traces in it. Harrah Al-Wabarah at Madinah western suburb, closer Madinah relative Harrah Waqim. Harrah Al-Wabarah differs from Harrah Waqim abundance plateaus ravines marshes lows highs, northern eastern edge dwellings Banu Salamah, under western edge Uruwah palace well farms, some Aqeeq palaces, northern edge Masjid Al-Qiblatayn. Southern western edge Atum Ad-Dahyan Quba fortress still towering evident. Noticeable two harras Harrah Al-Wabarah Harrah Waqim eastern meet their southwestern southeastern relative Madinah. Harrah name genus for distinct natural formation not determined site except added distinguishing from other harras, name Harrah came Bukhari stripped addition, that for fame Madinah's two harras, narrations context indicates intended harrah them, general hadiths came all in eastern harrah except Anas hadith news people Ukl or Uraynah particular western harrah, Ibn Hajar mentioned after cut hands feet branded eyes thrown this harrah, near place did what did. Harrah Banu Bayadah stoning Ma'iz ibn Malik occurred in it, as Al-Samhudi from Ibn Sa'd narration in story. From preceding scholars' sayings describing Madinah's two harras clear eastern harrah wider than western fitter dwelling, inhabited before the Prophet's migration to Madinah, western harrah urbanization arose edges time later predecessor, clear urbanization returned eastern harrah this era wider form took extend its parts expand areas, modern urbanization represents all urbanization kinds. Noticeable eastern harrah floods push to Madinah irrigate palms orchards entry Al-Ibti Madinah more clarification. See Madinah map clarifying two harras positions Madinah valleys Yaqut mentioned number harras spread Arabian peninsula, some spoke determined position some mentioned recited poetry evidence not determined, our place doesn't accommodate talk these harras multitude.","Translation":"The story talks about \"Harrat Al-Madinah Al-Sharqiyah,\" also known as \"Harrat Waqim.\" This area was the site of important historical events like the Battle of Al-Harrah in Yazid bin Muawiyah's days, where companions and their sons from Muhajirun and Ansar were killed. The story also mentioned Harrat Al-Wabarah in Medina's western suburb, Harrat Bani Bayadah, and Harrat Zahrah. These harrats were described with precise historical detail, focusing on their role in Medina's people's life anciently and modernly."},{"Place":"Al-Hadabah (Al-Mahsab)","City":"Mina Makkah Al-Mukarramah","Description":"Place upper Makkah. Al-Bukhari narrated from Aishah: Performed ihram with the Messenger Hajj Al-Wada' one who tamattu' not drive sacrifice claimed menstruated not purify till entered Arafah night said O Messenger this Arafah night only tamattu' Umrah. Messenger said: Undo your head comb refrain Umrah. Did when finished Hajj ordered Abd Ar-Rahman night Al-Hasabah perform Umrah from At-Tan'im place my Umrah. From Abu Hurayrah: The Prophet said morrow sacrifice day while Mina we descending tomorrow at Khayf Banu Kinanah where divided on disbelief meaning that Al-Mahsab. From Aishah: Only place the Prophet descended easier exit. Meaning Al-Abtah. From Ibn Abbas: Tahsub nothing only place the Messenger descended, peace be upon him. Ibn Hajar: Night Al-Hasabah fathah muhmal ha' sukun muhmal sad muwahhadah: night descended in Al-Mahsab, place descended after departure from Mina outside Makkah. Al-Azraqi narrated from Ibn Abbas: Al-Mahsab nothing only place the Messenger descended, peace be upon him. Sufyan from Amr ibn Dinar from Salih ibn Kaysan from Sulayman ibn Yasar from Abu Rabi' on the Prophet's baggage, peace be upon him: The Prophet not order me descend Al-Abtah but pitched tent came descended. Al-Mahsab limit from Al-Hujun ascending left ravine going Mina to Khurman wall elevated valley bottom, all that Al-Mahsab sometimes people many till in valley bottom. Al-Fakihi mentioned many sayings determining Al-Mahsab all not exit site Al-Azraqi said determining Al-Mahsab from Al-Hujun ascending to last mentioned, sayings mentioned differ some others names determine this place, some confusion between this Mahsab in Makkah Mahsab in Mina. Al-Fasi interpreted Al-Azraqi's determining Al-Mahsab from Mina side saying as for Al-Mahsab limit from Mina side occurred Al-Azraqi's talk implying to Khurman wall, Al-Awdan known Al-Khurmaniyyah upper Al-Mu'abidah. I found transcribed from Al-Shafi'i implying Al-Mahsab limit from Mina side Mount Al-Ayrah near sabīl called Sabil As-Sitt... Text saw for Al-Shafi'i as transmitted Sulayman ibn Khalil in manasik, Al-Shafi'i said Al-Mahsab between two mountains Mount Al-Ayrah other, at Makkah door Al-Abtah. Al-Fasi prolonged talk determining Al-Mahsab from Mina side, mentioned many sayings determining from Mina side names determine close some others. As for Al-Mahsab limit from Makkah side not differed as preceded. Yaqut: Al-Mahsab dammah fathah muhmal sad tashdid, passive from haseba or hasab throwing with pebbles, small pebbles large, place between Makkah Mina closer Mina, Makkah batha', Khayf Banu Kinanah limit from Al-Hujun going Mina Al-Asma'i limit between Shu'ab Amr to Shu'ab Banu Kinanah this from haseba in its land. Al-Mahsab also place throwing pebbles Mina this from throwing pebbles. Umar ibn Abi Rabi'ah said: Looked her at Al-Mahsab from Mina my look if not restraint adulterer. Said sun or church lamps appeared to you under curtain or dreaming. Distant earring goal if for Nawfal her father or Abd Shams Hashim. Curtain extended her day met hastily her maids following. Couldn't her except exchanged that evening her hand palms wrists. If called peers surrounded swaying or swayed them cushions. Sought youth till when obtained removed Muslimat oppressors. From preceding sayings clear Al-Mahsab name two places one Makkah the Prophet descended preceded determining with difference limits from Mina side. Second Mahsab Mina place throwing Jamrat, Al-Asma'i interpreted naming these two places transmitted from him Yaqut. Poets much mentioned Mahsab Mina, preceded what Ibn Abi Rabi'ah said, his saying also: Looked her at Al-Mahsab from Mina said sun rays sun shortens. Al-Farazdaq said: They heard day Al-Mahsab from Mina my call wrapped thin veils occasions. An-Nusayb said: Remembered you sacrifice day when appeared to us camel litters neared forenoon at Al-Mahsab. Litters upon marked veiled with green gilded farid. Rushdi Malhas investigator Al-Azraqi book determined Al-Mahsab saying valley between Makkah Mina, limit from Mina Mount Al-Ayrah near sabīl called Sabil As-Sitt Mina road as people mentioned, called Khayf Banu Kinanah, ravine Quraysh divided on disbelief, called also Al-Abtah Al-Batha' what flattened from valley widened. We say known today Al-Mu'abidah relative woman named Umm Abid dwelt this place as Makkah elders say. Hamd Al-Jasir commenting some ancients saying determining Al-Mahsab: Al-Mahsab place between Makkah Mina closer Mina limit from Al-Hujun going Mina place throwing Jamrat in Hajj(. This definition inherited from ancients but confusion between two places each called Al-Mahsab, seems sharing one description presence pebbles each with proximity caused confusion. Al-Mahsab anciently at Makkah edge upper its valley from Al-Hujun upward, place the Messenger descended, peace be upon him, came some scholars opinion about tahsub. As for second place Mahsab Mina at its lower adjoining Makkah in it Jamrah thrown, came this in ancient poetry, knowing two places dispenses quoting predecessors sayings (1). I say: From preceded early scholars' sayings later suffices knowing two Mahsab positions from Makkah from Mina, but this era no pebbles no batha' no mahsab, all natural geographic landmarks this spots vanished its land covered black asphalt, modern dwellings arose clothed all land, no trace batha' valley nor pebbles nor mahsab.","Translation":"This story talks about Al-Muhassab, a place between Mecca and Mina, where the Prophet, peace be upon him, descended.

Yaqut: Hadramawt fathah sukun fathah ra' mim two names compounded, declension if wish built first on fathah declined second undeclinable said this Hadar Mawt, if wish raised first in nominative jarred installed according factors, added to second said this Hadramawt declined Hadra khafad Mawt, you define first choose second between declension leaving, some dammah mim exit like ankabut, attribution Hadrami, diminutive Hudayr Mawt diminutive first them, likewise plural, said so-and-so from Al-Hadaramah, said named Hadir Mayt first dwelt, then dropped alif.

Hadramawt vast district east Aden near sea, around many sands known in dictionaries Al-Ahqaf, near it grave Hud peace be upon him, near it Barhut well, two cities one Tarim other Shibam, forts villages. Ibn Al-Faqih: Hadramawt Yemen district between it sea sands, between it Sada' district thirty farsakhs, between Hadramawt Sana'a seventy-two farsakhs, said eleven days journey. Al-Istakhri: Between Hadramawt Aden month journey. Amr ibn Ma'di Karib said: And Al-Ash'ath Al-Kindi when rose to us from Hadramawt sidelined males leader. Led steeds on faces lofty tall thin bellies emaciated flanks. As for conquest the Messenger corresponded its people among corresponded entered obedience, Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays came with some ten riders Muslim, the Messenger honored, when intended departure asked the Messenger appoint over them man them, appointed Ziyad ibn Labid Al-Bayadi Al-Ansari joined to him Kindah, remained till the Messenger died peace be upon him then Banu Wali'ah ibn Sharahbil ibn Mu'awiyah apostatized, his story Abu Bakr - pleased - wrote to Ziyad ibn Labid inform the Prophet's death peace be upon him, order take pledge from before him Hadramawt people, Ziyad stood addressed informed the Prophet's death peace be upon him, called pledge Abu Bakr, Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays refused pledge, secluded many Kindah, many others pledged, returned home took charity as did, took among taken young camel from Kindah youth, youth cried sought help from Harithah ibn Suraqah ibn Ma'di Karib ibn Wali'ah ibn Sharahbil ibn Mu'awiyah ibn Hujr O Abu Ma'd Karib tied daughter mare, Harithah came to Ziyad said: Release boy's young camel, refused said tied branded sultan's brand, Harithah rose untied tie young camel exited running to fellows, Harithah said: Prevents her elder cheeks white spotted as spotted cloth sharp on suspicion if suspicion. Ziyad rose shouted companions Muslims called to Allah support book, group Muslims sided Ziyad, who apostatized sided Harithah, Harithah said: Obeyed the Messenger while among us O people what me Abu Bakr matter. Inherit it eldest if dies after that for Amr Allah back breaker. Ziyad fought them day to night, came slave informed their four kings: Mukhawas Mushrih Hamd Abda' sister Al-Amardah Banu Ma'di Karib ibn Wali'ah in their enclosure drunk intoxicated, raided took slaughtered slaughter, Ziyad said: We killed four kings Hamd Mukhawas Mushrih Abda'. Called kings each had valley owns, Ziyad came with captives wealth passed Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays people, women children cried, Al-Ash'ath angered exited group people offered Ziyad with him, Muslims hit defeated, great Kindah gathered to Al-Ash'ath when Ziyad saw wrote Abu Bakr seek aid, Abu Bakr wrote to Al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayyah order aid him, met Al-Ash'ath dispersed multitudes killed great killing. Al-Baladhuri: Said governed the Messenger Ziyad ibn Labid Al-Bayadi from Ansar Hadramawt, then joined to him Kindah said who joined to him Kindah Abu Bakr pleased. Ziyad man firm strict, took charity some Kindah young camel, Kindah asked return take other, branded charity brand refused, Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays spoke to him not respond, said not return something mark fell upon. Kindah all rose except As-Sakun with him, their poet said: We supported religion when our people erred misery our shaykh son Umm Ziyad.

Then Ziyad came with captives wealth passed Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays people, women children screamed cried, Al-Ash'ath angered exited group people offered Ziyad with him, Muslims hit, then defeated them. Great Kindah gathered to Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays. When Ziyad saw wrote Abu Bakr seek aid, Abu Bakr wrote Al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayyah order aid him met Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays with Muslims, dispersed gathering struck companions, killed great killing.

Remained Madinah till marched to Sham Iraq raiding, died Kufah Al-Hasan prayed upon after reconciliation with Mu'awiyah. Al-Ash'ath nicknamed Abu Muhammad nicknamed Uraf An-Nar.

Came to them An-Najir opened asked Abu Bakr Muslims share booty did. I say: This summary describing Hadramawt lands ancient history, its history after authored works speak phases, this era known land fame dispenses talk about it, our place doesn't accommodate exhaustive talk its history different phases.","Translation":"This story talks about Islam's entry into Hadramaut in Yemen and Ziyad bin Labid Al-Ansari and Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq's efforts, may God be pleased with them, to spread religion.

Al-Bukhari narrated from Abdullah ibn Umar the Messenger raced between trained horses from Al-Hafya' goal Thaniyyat Al-Wada' raced untrained horses from Thaniyyah to Banu Zurayq mosque Abdullah ibn Umar among who raced.

A city in the Levant. Al-Bukhari narrated on the authority of Ubadah bin As-Samit, who was residing on the coast of Homs in a building with Umm Haram. Umayr—one of the narrators—said: Umm Haram told us that she heard the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) say: 'The first army from my nation to raid the sea has earned it.' Umm Haram said: 'O Messenger of Allah, am I among them?' He said: 'You are among them.' Then the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) said: 'The first army from my nation to raid the city of Caesar is forgiven.' I said: 'Am I among them, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'No.' Ibn Hajar said: The city of Caesar means Constantinople, and some suggested that the intended city of Caesar is the one where the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) said those words, which is Homs, and it was the seat of his kingdom at that time. Yaqut said: Homs with a kasrah then sukun, and sad undotted, a famous ancient large walled city, with a fortified citadel on a high hill in its southern part, between Damascus and Aleppo in the middle of the road, mentioned and feminized, built by a man called Homs bin Al-Mahr bin Jan bin Maknaf, or Homs bin Maknaf the Amalekite. As for its conquest, Abu Al-Mundhir narrated from Abu Mukhnaf that Abu Ubaydah bin Al-Jarrah, after finishing Damascus, advanced Khalid bin Al-Walid and Milhan bin Ziyar Al-Tai, then followed them. When they met at Homs, its people fought them, then retreated to the city and sought amnesty and peace, so they reconciled on 170,000 dinars. Al-Waqidi and others said: While the Muslims were at the gates of Damascus, a large enemy cavalry approached, so a group of Muslims went out to them between Bayt Lahya and Al-Thaniyah, and they fled defeated towards Homs via Qara until they reached Homs. They were fearful due to the flight of Heraclius from them, so they surrendered and sought amnesty. The Muslims granted them safety and withheld their hands from them. They brought out fodder and food for them and stayed at Al-Arnat, which is the river called Al-Asi. The leader of the Muslims was Al-Samt bin Al-Aswad Al-Kindi. When Abu Ubaydah finished with Damascus, he appointed Yazid bin Abi Sufyan over it, then proceeded to Homs via Baalbek and camped at Bab Al-Rastan. The people of Homs reconciled on safety for themselves, their properties, the wall of their city, their churches, and mills, excepting the revenue of the Church of John for the mosque, and stipulated tribute on those who remain. It was said: Rather, Al-Samt reconciled with them, and when Abu Ubaydah arrived, he confirmed the peace, and Al-Samt divided Homs into plots among the Muslims and settled them in every evacuated place or abandoned courtyard. Al-Baladhuri narrated similarly. In Al-Rawd Al-Mu'tar, Al-Himyari said: Homs is one of the widest cities in the Levant, and declension is not allowed in it as in Hind, because it is a foreign name, named after a giant called Homs, or a man from Amaleq who first settled it. It has a great river from which its people drink. It is a beautiful city on level ground, populated, and travelers aim for it with goods and merchandise of every kind. Its markets are active, its fertility complete, and livelihoods refined. Its women have beauty and good complexion. They drink from water coming in a canal from a stage away towards Damascus, and the inverted river flows at its gates at a stone's throw, with connected villages, orchards, trees, and large rivers from which fruits are brought to the city. Its soil is good for agriculture, and its air is the most balanced in the Levantine cities... All its alleys and roads are paved with solid stone, its agriculture blessed and abundant, sufficient with little rain or irrigation, and it has a large congregational mosque, one of the largest in the Levant, and from it to Aleppo five stages... It was opened by Abu Ubaydah bin Al-Jarrah by peace in year 14 during Umar's caliphate. Abdullah bin Qarit said: Abu Ubaydah camped around Homs for about eighteen nights and sent his agents to its regions and settled in his camp. Khalid bin Al-Walid died in Homs in year 21, or it was said he died in the Medina and Umar prayed over him. This is a summary of what historians mentioned about the city of Homs in its past. In this era, it remains a populous famous city in Syria, located between Damascus and Aleppo, clear on the map of Syria, where many paved roads meet connecting it to many prosperous Syrian cities.","Translation":"This story talks about Homs city, one of Levant's cities. Mentioned in a noble Prophetic hadith as the first of his armies invading the sea, mentioning companion Ubadah bin Al-Samit died and buried there, plus historical events there, Islamic conquests, and their impact over ages."},{"Place":"Hunayn","City":"Mecca and Taif","Description":"A place between Mecca and Taif. Allah Almighty said: 'Indeed, Allah has given you victory on many battlefields and on the day of Hunayn when you took pleasure in your great number but it availed you nothing' (Surah At-Tawbah, verse 25). Al-Bukhari narrated on the authority of Ismail who said: I saw a strike on the hand of Ibn Abi Awfa, he said: I struck it with the Prophet (PBUH) on the day of Hunayn. Ibn Hajar said: Hunayn with undotted ha and noon diminutive: a valley beside Dhi Al-Majaz near Taif, between it and Mecca a few dozen miles from Arafat side. Abu Ubayd Al-Bakri said it was named after Hunayn bin Qaniyah bin Mahla'il. Ibn Hajar said: Almighty says: 'Indeed, Allah has given you victory' O believers in places of war where you settle yourselves to meet your enemy, and scenes where you and they meet many, 'and on the day of Hunayn' also He gave you victory. Hunayn is a valley as mentioned between Mecca and Taif, and it is run because it is masculine name for masculine, and may be left unrun intending it as name for the town it is in, from which the poet's saying: They supported their prophet and strengthened his back in Hunayn on the day the heroes faltered. Narrated on the authority of Urwah: (Hunayn) a valley beside Dhi Al-Majaz. Narrated on the authority of Qatadah on His saying: 'Indeed, Allah has given you victory in many battlefields and on the day of Hunayn', said: Hunayn is between Mecca and Taif, the Prophet fought Hawazin and Thaqif there, mentioned that he went out that day with the Messenger of Allah twelve thousand: ten thousand from Muhajirun and Ansar, and two thousand from the freed ones, and it was mentioned that a man said that day: We will not be defeated today due to multitude. Al-Qurtubi said: The Messenger of Allah proceeded until he reached Hunayn valley in Tihamah, and Hawazin had ambushed on the sides of the valley at dawn twilight, so they charged on the Muslims as one man, the majority of Muslims fled and no one turned to another. The Messenger of Allah stood firm, and with him Abu Bakr and Umar, and from his household Ali and Abbas and Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin Abdul Muttalib and his son Ja'far, and Usamah bin Zaid, and Ayman bin Ubaid - Ayman bin Umm Ayman killed that day in Hunayn - and Rabi'ah bin Al-Harith and Al-Fadl bin Abbas, or in place of Ja'far bin Abi Sufyan Qutham bin Abbas, so these are ten men, for this Abbas said: We supported the Messenger of Allah in war nine, and those who fled fled and withdrew, and our tenth met death by himself, with what afflicted him for Allah not to grieve. And Umm Sulaym stood firm among those who stood, girded holding a camel for Abu Talhah with a dagger in her hand. The Messenger of Allah did not flee nor any of these. Yaqut said: Hunayn may be diminutive of Al-Hanan which is mercy, diminutive of softening, or diminutive of Al-Han which is a tribe of jinn, Al-Suhayli said named after Hunayn bin Qaniyah bin Mahla'il, said and I think from Amaleq, narrated from Abu Ubayd Al-Bakri, and it is the day mentioned by Almighty in His noble book, near Mecca, said: it is a valley before Taif, or a valley beside Dhi Al-Majaz, Al-Waqidi said between it and Mecca three nights, said between it and Mecca a few dozen miles, mentioned and feminized, if intended the valley masculinized and declined as Almighty said: 'and on the day of Hunayn when you took pleasure in your great number', and if intended the town and spot feminized not declined as the poet's saying: They supported their prophet and strengthened his back in Hunayn on the day the heroes faltered. Al-Bakri said: Hunayn valley near Taif between it and Mecca a few dozen miles, and mostly masculinized because it is name of water, Abbas bin Mirdas said: Approached morning until we left evening Hunayn and its flows poured blood. And sometimes Arabs feminized it because it is name of the spot, Hassan said: They supported their prophet and strengthened his back in Hunayn on the day the heroes faltered. It is the place where the Messenger of Allah defeated Hawazin, said named after Hunayn bin Qaniyah bin Mahla'il. I said: In the above sayings of scholars you see difference in determining Hunayn's location, distance between it and Mecca, and between it and Taif, the closest sayings to truth in determining distance between it and Mecca some said between it and Mecca a few dozen miles. As for some said it is a valley before Taif it is incorrect, the fact it is near Mecca - as some said. Al-Hamdani said Ahmad bin Isa Al-Rada'i in his Arjuzah which he drew the Hajj road from Yemen to Mecca: To the estate of Al-Talihi straight, departing from it aiming Al-Zaymah, then on old Sabuha where the permanent rock's post, pitched in the determined march to Arik ascending its core, praiseworthy in the caravan not blameworthy, its roots remaining noble, I hope to see it safe, praised in the caravan not blameworthy. Al-Talihi's estate from Quraish old palms, Al-Zaymah in Abdullah bin Ubayd Allah Al-Hashimi's garden, Sabuha place, Arik ascent added to place said Arik ascent with dammah on alif. Then diverted and Khuda on contraction, Al-Jadhami's well with caution, to Hunayn the gushing spring, until if poured into Al-Mashash, where the rock's post no avoidance, hastened with longing overwhelming. Al-Jadhami's wells a built well, Al-Jadhami from Mecca people. Hunayn where Hunayn battle between the Prophet and Hawazin, Al-Mashash place where Yemen and Najd Hajj roads meet and Iraq and Bahrain roads. I said: Thus Al-Rada'i drew the road and determined Hunayn's location, proceeded in this order Al-Zaymah, Sabuha, Al-Jadhami's well, Hunayn, mentioned Hunayn a gushing spring, i.e. water source gushing with much water. Muhammad bin Bulayhid said: Wadi Al-Shara'i' and name Al-Shara'i' recent, some contemporaries claimed it is famous Hunayn in Islamic history mentioned by Allah Almighty: 'and on the day of Hunayn when you took pleasure in your great number' (Surah At-Tawbah verse 25), and those springs are Hunayn's springs, I say: Hunayn valley has no springs, if there were any biographers would not neglect it, the correct is Hunayn the valley parallel to Al-Shara'i' on the right of going from Mecca to Taif, distant from Al-Shara'i' southward three thousand meters, we mention this determination relying on authentic saying mentioned by Ibn Hisham in his Sira when mentioning Hunayn battle, Ibn Hisham said when the polytheists descended to Awatas, Durayd bin Al-Simmah with Hawazin an old sheikh said: In which valley are you? They said Awatas, he said descend, good for horses' arena, not rough mountain nor soft plain, the battle was in it, it remains by this name now, the battle extended near Haram miles, then Hawazin defeated and battle extended near Al-Zaymah his saying the battle was in it and what after from his saying it, not from Ibn Hisham's narration. Sirah people said in mentioning their camp they descended the ravine from Hunayn, we take from that they descended a valley and from Durayd's story that valley is Awatas, not far that the ravine called Awatas and the valley called Hunayn, because in Awatas ravine ancient wells traces. I said: Noticed in this text he denied springs in Hunayn, claiming if in Hunayn springs biographers would not neglect, this relative to his knowledge. Second he said the correct Hunayn the valley parallel to Al-Shara'i' on the right of going from Mecca to Taif and did not mention this valley's name. Third mentioned Hawazin's camp in Awatas valley and did not mention the Prophet and his companions' camp. Fourth: said from Durayd's story that valley is Awatas, not far the ravine called Awatas and the valley called Hunayn, because in Awatas ravine ancient wells. I said as for denying springs in Hunayn it is refuted by authentic reports, Al-Fakihi said mentioning Zubaida's charitable works in Mecca and brought springs from the lawful from them Mashash spring, made for it pools for floods to gather in, then brought springs from Hunayn, bought Hunayn wall, diverted its spring to the pool, made its wall a dam gathering the flood, Mecca people drink from its water to our day. Al-Azraqi in his narration about Zubaida's works: brought into it - Mecca - springs from the lawful, from them a spring from Al-Mashash, made for it pools for floods to gather in, then brought springs from Hunayn, bought Hunayn wall, diverted its spring to the pool, made its wall a dam gathering the flood, became for her honor not for anyone before her. In Al-Rada'i's Arjuzah said: Then diverted and Khuda on contraction Al-Jadhami's well with caution to Hunayn the gushing spring until if poured into Al-Mashash and by this Al-Rada'i clarified Hunayn a gushing spring, i.e. water place gushing with much water. As for his saying the correct Hunayn the valley parallel to Al-Shara'i' on right of going from Mecca it is saying not relying on evidence. In third and fourth attributed the battle to Awatas while famous in Quran and Sirah it in Hunayn, noticed at end his narration made Awatas and Hunayn one place while famous they two valleys each called by name known by. Said in another place after mentioning what Yaqut mentioned in determining it a place we exhausted standing on its truth, from this era's books who said about Al-Shara'i' spring it Hunayn spring, this close to truth if not Hunayn spring then close to it in the valley south of Al-Shara'i' because close to Dhi Al-Majaz mentioned at end Al-Suhayli's narration. I said in this text difference from previous text and response to his saying relative to Hunayn springs and location. Hamad Al-Ayidi in his additions to one Arab magazine parts many writers think Zubaida's spring brought to Mecca honorable its sources south Shaddad, correct it Hunayn spring at bottom Al-Shara'i' known today as Samha spring, revived years ago Sheikh Hamad Al-Sulayman Al-Hamdan former finance ministry deputy and flowed its water to farm he established there. Yamaniyah palm then Qarn Al-Manazil then Taif, not Hunayn before Wajj, Hunayn near Mecca in Tihamah, its place known now as Al-Shara'i', great village, east of it valley called Yada'an where Hunayn battle occurred, known now as Jada'an with jim. Hamad Al-Jasir commenting on one writers: Awatas and Hunayn two places between them tens miles, one in Tihamah other east Hijaz mountains outside it Hunayn upper Al-Shara'i' valley its name Yada'an commoners replace ya with jim say: Jada'an (Nasr Al-Iskandari said in his manuscript book Yada'an valley with mosque for the Prophet (PBUH), where Hawazin camped day Hunayn, in Nakhlah valley. Yaqut quoted this, did not mention source. Saying it in Nakhlah valley with liberty, near Yamaniyah Nakhlah south of it, not in it. As for Awatas closest inhabited places from it Ashira, was station from Najd Hajj road stations, now village... Bujayr bin Zuhayr bin Abi Salma said: Was burden day Batin Hunayn and morning Awatas and day Al-Abraq in Maghazi books valley from Tihamah valleys hollow sloping, descended in slope - defeat befell Muslims first, then stood and won until defeated their enemies some fled to Taif some fled to Awatas some headed to Nakhlah and the Messenger sent in traces who headed to Awatas before from Muslims defeated gathered there from enemies. Hamad Al-Jasir commenting on some one writer said Hunayn valley near Mecca beside Dhi Al-Majaz and it valley known now as Al-Shara'i' (upper it Yada'an commoners replace ya with jim say: (Jada'an) not beside Dhi Al-Majaz at near Arafat, but its flood pours to it, distance between them short Hamad Al-Jasir said among most famous historical places near Mecca Hunayn valley (Yada'an) upper Al-Shara'i' valley, where the event mentioned in noble Quran occurred: 'and on the day of Hunayn when you took pleasure in your great number but it availed you nothing' (Surah At-Tawbah verse 25), good to point differentiation between Hunayn and Awatas places, where some historians occurred what understands from it considering them one place, with their difference, Awatas east Hijaz mountains chain closest inhabited places from it Ashira, west Wadi Al-Aqiq near Al-Birkah north by mile towards west. Atiq Al-Biladi - after mentioning what Yaqut and Al-Bakri said in determining Hunayn -: Hunayn known today as Al-Shara'i', on road Mecca from Yamaniyah Nakhlah valley flows from Taad and Al-Tanadub mountains, then descends west passing between Labn and Kanthil mountains, its head called Al-Sadr and bottom Al-Shara'i', then pours in upper Urnah near Dhi Al-Majaz north, its tributaries Wadi Yada'an, Hunayn distant from Mecca (26) kila east, from Haram borders (11) kila, from Najd road sign, its inhabitants Hudhayl and Ashraf. I said: From scholars' sayings above in determining Hunayn's location and geographic description likely Hunayn the valley called in this era Al-Shara'i', some stated that based on their study and viewing. Ibn Ishaq talked about Hunayn expedition said: When Hawazin heard the Messenger conquered Mecca, gathered to Malik bin Awf Al-Nadri, gathered with Hawazin Thaqif all, gathered Nasr and Jusham all and Sa'd bin Bakr and people from Bani Hilal few, none from Qays Aylan attended except these, absent from it from Hawazin Ka'b and Kilab, none from them attended with name, in Bani Jusham Durayd bin Al-Simmah old sheikh, nothing in him but blessing with his opinion and knowledge of war, old experienced, in Thaqif two lords, in allies Qarib bin Al-Aswad bin Mas'ud bin Mu'attib, in Bani Malik Dhu Al-Khimar Sabi' bin Al-Harith bin Malik, and his brother Ahmar bin Al-Harith, command people to Malik bin Awf Al-Nadri. When resolved march to the Messenger gathered with people their properties and women, when descended Awatas people gathered to him, with them Durayd bin Al-Simmah in his litter led, when descended said: In which valley are you? Said Awatas, said yes horses' arena, not rough mountain nor soft plain, why I hear camels' braying, donkeys' braying, children's crying, sheep's bleating, said Malik bin Awf drove with people their properties women and children, said: Where Malik? Said this Malik, called him, said O Malik you became leader your people, this day has what after from days, why I hear camels' braying, donkeys' braying, children's crying, sheep's bleating? Said drove with people their properties children and women, said why that? Said: Wanted make behind every man his family and property to fight for them, said shepherd sheep by Allah, does defeated return anything? If for you helped you not but man with his sword and spear, if against you disgraced in your family and property, then said what did Ka'b and Kilab? Said none from them attended, said absent edge and effort, if day elevation and raising not absent from it Ka'b and Kilab, wished you did what Ka'b and Kilab did, who attended from you? Said Amr bin Amir and Awf bin Amir, said those two young from Amir, not benefit nor harm, O Malik you did not do by advancing egg Hawazin's egg to horses' throats anything, raise them to rugged their land and upper their people, then throw the morning on horses' backs, if for you followed you who behind you, if against you afflicted that preserved your family and property. Said by Allah not do that, you aged and aged your mind by Allah obey me O Hawazin or lean on this sword until exits from my back. Hated Durayd bin Al-Simmah have mention or opinion in it, said obeyed you said Durayd bin Al-Simmah this day not attended and not missed me: Wish I in it young, crawl in it and place, lead flock the flocks like sheep split. Ibn Ishaq said when the Messenger resolved march to Hawazin to meet them, mentioned to him at Safwan bin Umayyah armors and weapons for him, sent to him while he pagan then, said O Abu Umayyah lend us this your weapon meet in it our enemy tomorrow, said Safwan forcefully O Muhammad? Said no loan guaranteed until return it to you, said no harm this, gave him hundred armor with what suffices from weapon, claimed the Messenger asked him suffice them transport did. Said then went out the Messenger with him two thousand from Mecca people with ten thousand his companions who went out with him conquered Mecca by them, so twelve thousand, appointed the Messenger Attab bin Asid bin Abi Al-Is bin Umayyah bin Abd Shams on Mecca prince on who stayed behind from people, then proceeded the Messenger on his way intending meeting Hawazin. Narrated Ibn Ishaq on authority of Jabir bin Abdullah said when we faced Hunayn valley descended in valley from Tihamah valleys hollow sloping, descending in it descent, in dawn dimness, people preceded us to the valley, ambushed us in its ravines and bends and places, prepared and ready, by Allah startled us descending except battalions charged on us charge one man, people retreated no one turns to another. The Messenger deviated to right, then said: Where O people? Come to me, I Messenger of Allah, I Muhammad bin Abdullah said nothing, camels carried some on some, people went, except remained with the Messenger group from Muhajirun and Ansar and his household. Ibn Ishaq said when people defeated, saw who with the Messenger from rough Mecca people the defeat, men from them spoke what in their selves from grudge, Abu Sufyan bin Harb said their defeat not end before the sea, and the arrows with him in his quiver, shouted Jabalah bin Al-Hanbal, with his brother Safwan bin Umayyah pagan in the period the Messenger made for him not magic invalid today, said Safwan shut may Allah split your mouth by Allah to rule me man from Quraish better than rule me man from Hawazin. Ibn Ishaq said some Mecca people told me the Messenger said when separated from Mecca to Hunayn, saw multitude with him from Allah's soldiers we not defeated from few. Ibn Ishaq claimed some people man from Bani Bakr said it. Narrated Ibn Ishaq on authority of Al-Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib, said I with the Messenger holding rein his white mule had veiled it, I man large strong voice, the Messenger said when saw what saw from people: Where O people? Saw people not turn to anything, said O Abbas shout O assembly Ansar O assembly Samurah's companions, said answered: At your service, at your service, man goes to turn his camel not able on that, takes his armor throws it on his neck, takes his sword and shield, dismounts from his camel, lets it go, aims the voice until ends to the Messenger, until gathered to him hundred faced people fought, call first O to Ansar, then restricted finally O to Khazraj were patient at war, overlooked the Messenger in his stirrups, looked at people's fighting they fighting said now heated the oven. Said: Fought people, by Allah not returned people's return from their defeat until found captives bound at the Messenger. Ibn Ishaq said when Hawazin defeated intensified killing from Thaqif in Bani Malik, killed from them seventy man under their flag, among them Uthman bin Abdullah bin Rabi'ah bin Al-Harith bin Habib, their flag with Dhu Al-Khimar, when killed took it Uthman bin Abdullah fought with it until killed, when reached the Messenger his killing said Allah distance him he hated Quraish Ibn Ishaq: When polytheists defeated, came Taif with them Malik bin Awf, camped some in Awatas, headed some towards Nakhlah, none headed towards Nakhlah except Bani Ghubrah from Thaqif, followed horse the Messenger who took in Nakhlah from people not followed who took passes. Ibn Ishaq sent the Messenger in traces who headed before Awatas Abu Amir Al-Ash'ari, overtook from people some defeated, skirmished them arrow killed Abu Amir, took the flag Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari - his cousin - fought them, Allah opened on his hands defeated them. Ibn Ishaq then gathered to the Messenger captives Hunayn and its properties, over spoils Mas'ud bin Amr Al-Ghifari, ordered the Messenger captives and properties to Al-Ji'ranah detained there. Ibn Ishaq: Went out the Messenger when turned from Taif on Dahna until descended Al-Ji'ranah with who with him from people, then came to him delegation Hawazin at Al-Ji'ranah, with the Messenger from Hawazin captives six thousand children and women, and from camels and sheep what not known its number. Ibn Ishaq what narrated on authority of Abdullah bin Amr that Hawazin delegation came the Messenger had converted, said O Messenger we root and clan, afflicted us affliction not hidden from you, grace us may Allah grace you, said stood man from Hawazin, one Bani Sa'd bin Bakr, called Zuhayr, nicknamed Abu Surad, said O Messenger only in enclosures your paternal aunts and maternal aunts and nurses who nursed you, said: the Messenger said (your children and women dearer to you or your properties?) said O Messenger chose us between our properties and honors, return to us our women and children dearer to us, said to them (what for me and Bani Abdul Muttalib for you, when I prayed noon with people stand say we intercede with Messenger to Muslims, and with Muslims to Messenger in our children and women, give you at that and ask for you). When the Messenger prayed noon with people stood spoke what ordered them, said the Messenger: (what for me and Bani Abdul Muttalib for you), said Muhajirun what for us for Messenger, said Ansar what for us for Messenger. Said Al-Aqra' bin Habis: as for me and Bani Tamim no, said Uyaynah bin Hisn: as for me and Bani Fazarah no, said Abbas bin Mirdas as for me and Bani Sulaym no. Said Bani Sulaym yes, what for us for Messenger. Said says Abbas bin Mirdas to Bani Sulaym you weakened me the Messenger said as for who clung from you to his right from this captive for him for every person six mares, from first captive I get, returned to people their children and women I said this summary what Ibn Hisham mentioned from Hunayn expedition news briefly stripped from side news and poems said in this expedition and specifying appeased hearts with much giving from Hunayn spoils. Hunayn also with undotted and ya between two noons: small bay small ships enter north Rabigh between Al-Kharar and Masturah, adjacent south Al-Ra's Al-Abyad, in it Al-Zaba'ir may be Hunayn this shelter for some smugglers. And Ras Hunayn head at that bay's end said Atiq Al-Biladi.","Translation":"The story covers the Hunayn expedition after Mecca's conquest, where the Messenger Muhammad, peace be upon him, led Muslims, ending in Muslim victory, spoils of captives and money. The text talks about distributing spoils to Muslims and giving them choice between keeping or requesting money and lineage from the Prophet, peace be upon him, if wanting return to Medina. It ended returning women and children to families and money afterward, and author Atiq Al-Biladi talked about Ras Hunayn near Rabigh north adjoining Ras Al-Bayda' known as Ras Al-Kharar."},{"Place":"Al-Hirah","City":"Iraq","Description":"A city in northern Iraq. Al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih from Adi bin Hatim said while I with the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) man came complained to him poverty then another complained road cut, said O Adi, have you seen Al-Hirah? Said not seen it informed about it, said if your life prolonged you see the traveler depart from Al-Hirah until circumambulates the Ka'bah not fearing anyone but Allah. The hadith. Yaqut said Al-Hirah with kasrah then sukun, ra city was three miles from Al-Kufah, on place called Al-Najm, and by Al-Hirah Al-Khurnaq near it towards east about mile, and Al-Sadir in middle desert between it and Levant, was residence Arab kings in Jahiliyyah, from Nusr then from Lakhm Al-Nu'man and his fathers, attribution to it Hari unusually, Amr bin Ma'di Karib said: As if the antimony Hari from it pours where tears rush. And Hiri also on analogy, all came from them, called Al-Hirah Al-Rawha' Asim bin Amr said: Morninged Al-Hirah Al-Rawha' horses and foot on saddles' tops attended in its sides palaces towering like dogs' molars. As for describing it white intending good building, said named Al-Hirah because Tuba' the greater when intended Khorasan left weak his army at that place said to them stay by it i.e. reside by it. Al-Zujaji said first settled it Malik bin Zuhayr bin Amr bin Fahm bin Taym Allah bin Asad bin Wabrah bin Taghlib bin Hulwan bin Imran bin Lahaf bin Quda'ah, when settled made it camp distributed to his people named Al-Hirah by that. In some Sirah people news Ardashir marched to Al-Ardawan Nabt king, differed on him and rebelled king from Nabt kings called Baba, each sought aid from neighboring Arabs to fight the other with them, Al-Ardawan built camp settled who aided him from Arabs named that camp Al-Hirah, Baba settled who aided him from Bedouins Al-Anbar and dug trench around them, Bukhtanasr called Arabs gathered who in his lands from Arabs to it Nabt named it Anbar Al-Arab, as named food Anbar when food gathered to it. In Ahmad bin Muhammad Al-Hamadhani's book named Al-Hirah because Tuba' when came with his armies reached Al-Hirah place his guide lost and confused named Al-Hirah. Abu Al-Mundhir Hisham bin Muhammad beginning Arabs settlement Iraq land and their taking Al-Hirah and Al-Anbar home that Allah (PBUH) revealed to Yuhanna bin Khatiyar bin Zir Babel bin Shlish from Judah bin Jacob's children come to Bukhtanasr order him raid Arabs who no locks for their houses nor doors, tread their lands with soldiers, kill their fighters, plunder their properties, inform them their disbelief in me, taking gods besides me, denying my prophets and messengers, Yuhanna came from Najran until came to Bukhtanasr in Babel informed him what revealed to him, that in time Ma'd bin Adnan, said Bukhtanasr on who in his lands from Arab merchants gathered who overpowered from them, built for them camp on Al-Najaf fortified it, then made them in it, appointed guards and keepers on them, then called in people for raid prepared for that, news spread to neighboring Arabs. Tribes from them came peaceful seeking amnesty, consulted in them Bukhtanasr Yuhanna said their exit to you from their land before rising to you return from what were on, accept from them and good to them, settled Al-Sawad on Euphrates shore, built their camp place named Al-Anbar, released Al-Hirah people, built in its place named Al-Hirah because was built camp, remained so duration Bukhtanasr's life, when died joined Al-Anbar people, Al-Hirah remained ruined long time, no ascent from Arab lands to it, Al-Anbar people and who joined from Al-Hirah people from Arab tribes in their place. Became in Al-Hirah from all tribes: from Madhhij, Himyar, Tayy, Kalb, Tamim, many from Tanukh Al-Anbar and Al-Hirah to Euphrates shore and its west, except they Bedouins dwelling camps and hair tents, not dwelling mud houses, their homes between Al-Anbar and Al-Hirah, called Arabs Al-Dahiyah first ruled from them in time factions kings Malik bin Fahm father Jadhimah Al-Abrash, his home towards Al-Anbar, then died ruled Jadhimah Al-Abrash bin Malik bin Fahm, Jadhimah from best Arab kings. I said this some what Yaqut mentioned about Al-Hirah - derivation its name and origin and inhabitants - prolonged in his talk about this city In Al-Rawd Al-Mu'tar Al-Himyari said Al-Hirah small Jahili city good building pleasant soil, was in past larger than seen after that most its people moved to Al-Kufah. In Al-Hirah homes Bani Buqaylah and others, was homes Bani Nasr and Lakhm, they Al-Nu'man bin Al-Mundhir son and first left Al-Hirah Amr bin Adi bin Nasr took it kingdom seat, most Al-Hirah people Christians, from Arab tribes on Christianity from Bani Tamim Al Adi Bani Zayd Al-Ibadi the poet, from Sulaym and Tayy and others... Al-Hirah land cold in winter, in summer excessive heat... Its prosperity decreased since Al-Kufah built to Al-Mu'tadid days, then ruin overcame it... Were in it many monasteries and monks went to other lands for ruin overtaking it. Settled it group from Abbasid caliphs for good its air, clear its atmosphere, near Al-Khurnaq and Al-Najaf from it, duration Al-Hirah from first time its building to first ruin when Al-Kufah built five hundred years and thirty some years. a. h. Al-Mas'udi talked about Al-Hirah and its kings said: number kings in Al-Hirah twenty three kings from Bani Nasr and others from Arabs and Persians, duration their rule six hundred years and twenty two years and eight months, said prosperity Al-Hirah and its beginning to ruined when Al-Kufah built, was five hundred years and thirty some years. Its prosperity decreased from time we mentioned to early Al-Mu'tadid days, then ruin overtook it, group from Abbasid caliphs - Al-Saffah, Al-Mansur, Al-Rashid, and others - settled it and prolonged stay for good its air, health its soil and solidity, near Al-Khurnaq and Al-Najaf from it, were in it many monasteries with monks, went to other lands, for ruin's approach, deserted from every familiar in this time only echo and owl. Al-Baladhuri said Khalid - meaning Khalid bin Al-Walid - intending to Al-Hirah, out to him Abdul Masih bin Amr bin Qays bin Hayyan bin Buqaylah, Buqaylah name Al-Harith from Al-Azd, and Hani' bin Qabisah bin Mas'ud Al-Shaybani, and Iyas bin Qabisah Al-Tai, said Farwah bin Iyas, Iyas Kisra Abarwiz's agent on Al-Hirah after Al-Nu'man bin Al-Mundhir, reconciled on hundred thousand dirhams said on eighty thousand dirhams every year, on be spies for Muslims on Persia people, not demolish for them church nor palace. Abu Mukhnaf narrated from Abu Al-Muthanna Al-Walid bin Al-Qatami, Al-Sharqi bin Al-Qatami Al-Kalbi, Abdul Masih met Khalid, old aged, said to him Khalid from where your farthest trace O sheikh?

Said yes, and bind said woe to you, only speak to you people's speech. Said and I only answer you people's answer. Said Muslim you or war said rather peace. Said then what these fortresses? Said built them for the fool until the forbearing comes. Then discussed peace reconciled on hundred thousand pay every year was first money carried to Medina from Iraq, stipulated not betray Muslims evil and be aid on Persia people, that in year 12 I said this summary what historians mentioned from Al-Hirah history before Islam and after until ruin crept in and its inhabitants dispersed since Al-Kufah city prospered.","Translation":"This story talks about Al-Hirah city, capital of ancient Al-Hirah kingdom north Iraq.

The ditch effaced its trace today not remain in it thing known except its side, because Bathan valley overtook the ditch place became its flood on the ditch place. a. h.

Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah intensified on them in some the ditch boulder, complained it to the Messenger, called for vessel water, spat in it, then prayed what Allah willed pray by, then sprinkled that water on that boulder, says who attended it by who sent him with truth, crumbled until became like dune not repel axe nor shovel. When finished the Messenger from the ditch approached Quraish until descended at meeting torrents, from Ruma, between Al-Jurf and Zaghabah, in ten thousand from their Abyssinians and who followed from Bani Kinanah and Tihamah people, approached Ghatfan and who followed from Najd people, until descended Dhunb Naqmi, beside Uhud. Went out the Messenger and Muslims, until made their backs to Sal', in three thousand from Muslims, struck there his camp the ditch between him and the people. Appointed on Medina Ibn Umm Maktum, ordered children and women made in forts. Intensified there affliction, intensified fear, came their enemy from above them and from below them, until believers thought every thought, hypocrisy appeared from some hypocrites, stayed the Messenger and stayed on him polytheists some twenty night, near month, not war between them except arrows shooting and siege. Ibn Hisham said said Salman the Persian suggested it - the ditch - to the Messenger, said narrated to me some knowledge people Muhajirun day the ditch said Salman from us, Ansar said Salman from us, the Messenger said: Salman from us household. Al-Suhayli said digging the ditch not Arabs' habit, but Persians' stratagems and wars, therefore Salman the Persian suggested it, first who ditched ditches from Persians kings what Al-Tabari mentioned Manushahr bin Abirj bin Afridun. Al-Suhayli then Nu'aym bin Mas'ud bin Amir bin Unayf Tha'labah bin Qanfudh bin Hilal bin Khulawah bin Ashja' bin Rayth bin Ghatfan, came the Messenger said O Messenger I converted my people not know my conversion, order me what you wish, the Messenger said (you in us man one, weaken about us if able for war deception)... went out until came Bani Qurayzah : then went out until came Quraish ... then went out until came Ghatfan worked between them division until slackened some from some, sent Allah on them wind in winter nights cold severe cold, began overturn their pots and throw their buildings, then said Abu Sufyan O Quraish people you by Allah not became residence place, perished the pasturage and light, Bani Qurayzah betrayed us, reached us from them what we hate, met from wind severity what you see, not settle for us pot, nor stand for us fire, nor hold for us building, depart for I departing, then stood to his camel hobbled, sat on it, then struck it jumped with it on three, by Allah not untie its hobble except standing.

Liked Salman's opinion Muslims ... rode the Messenger horse with him group from his companions from Muhajirun and Ansar sought place descend, most liked descents to him make Sal' behind his back and ditch from Al-Mizad to Dhubab to Ratij, worked that day in the ditch, called people informed them enemy near and their camp to Sal' slope made Muslims work hastening hasten enemy coming on them, the Messenger began work with them in the ditch to motivate Muslims, borrowed from Bani Qurayzah much tools from shovels and picks and baskets, dig by the ditch - they that day peace to the Prophet dislike Quraish coming - appointed the Messenger on each side from the ditch people dig it, Muhajirun digging from Ratij side to Dhubab, Ansar digging from Dhubab to Bani Ubayd mountain, rest Medina connected with building. Youth carrying soil, the ditch width five or so, Muhajirun and Ansar carrying on their heads in baskets, when returned with baskets made in it stones come by from Sal' mountain. Made soil what towards the Prophet and his companions, made stones towards them like date mountains, stones from greatest their weapons throw them by, the Messenger that day carrying soil in baskets throws it, competed people that day in Salman the Persian Muhajirun said Salman from us, strong knowing digging ditches. Ansar said he from us we more entitled him, reached the Messenger their saying said Salman man from us household. Indeed that day worked work ten men until aided him that day Qays bin Abi Sa'sa'ah, delayed him, asked the Messenger said order him perform wudu for him, bathe by it, overturn the vessel behind him, did as if released from bond. Narrated on authority of Jabir bin Abdullah said indeed saw Salman that day, made for him five cubits length and five in ground, not wait him until finished alone, says O Allah no living except afterlife living. Not in Muslims that day one except digs in the ditch or carries soil, indeed seen the Messenger and Abu Bakr and Umar - Abu Bakr and Umar not separate in work nor travel nor home - carrying soil in their clothes that day from haste, if not find baskets for Muslims haste The ditch what between Bani Ubayd mountain Khuzbi to Ratij, for Muhajirun from Dhubab to Ratij, for Ansar what between Dhubab to Khuzbi this what dug the Messenger and Muslims connected Medina with building from every side it like fortress. Al-Mutri said the Messenger dug length from upper Wadi Bathan west the valley, with the lava to west Eid prayer place, then to Al-Fath mosque then to two small mountains in west the valley called one Ratij other Bani Ubayd mountain, made Muslims their backs to Sal' mountain struck the Messenger his tent on the peak in west Sal' mountain... the ditch between them and polytheists, effaced trace the ditch today not remain from it thing except its side, because the valley Wadi Bathan overtook on the ditch place became its course in the ditch place. Ibn Al-Najjar said the ditch today remaining in it canal comes from Quba spring to palms at bottom Medina by Al-Sayh around Al-Fath mosque, in the ditch palms buried most and walls collapsed Ahmad Al-Abbasi concludes from what Al-Tabarani and Al-Bayhaqi and Ibn Sa'd narrated the Prophet drew the ditch from Ajmah Al-Shaykhayn end Bani Harithah behind Bani Abdul Ashhal, i.e. end eastern lava until reached Al-Mizad passed Bani Salimah homes towards Al-Fath mosque and Bani Ubayd mountain, there western lava, then cut forty cubits for every ten, Muhajirun and Ansar disputed in Salman the Persian, the Prophet said (from us household) Muhajirun from Ratij side to Dhubab Ansar digging from Dhubab to Bani Salimah homes Bani Ubayd mountain, result the ditch northern Medina from end eastern lava to end western lava... one Medina sides exposed rest sides connected with building and palms enemy not able from it. a. h. The ditch effaced its trace today not remain from it thing known except its side, because Wadi Bathan overtook on the ditch places became its flood the ditch place. Al-Shanqiti said the ditch considered from military plans Muslims Arabs preceded to work it, since Medina surrounded with natural fortifications from its east and south and west what surrounds it from rough lavas, no ambition for armies in crossing it, with what intersperses it from villages and farms and palms what scatters and disperses any army thinks coming from it, but northern side military entrance exposed not fortified, not invaded Medina over ages except from it, invaded it Tuba' from there... as came from it polytheists in Uhud battle, tried attack from it in Al-Ahzab battle, therefore necessary fortify this side, fortified it the Chosen (Peace Be Upon Him) with the ditch, dug it from end eastern lava at Ajmah Al-Shaykhayn east what known now as Al-Mustarah mosque, until slope Bani Salimah lava to east from Al-Qiblatayn, length (2725) meters, in arc open shape, worked in it thousand and five hundred from Muslims, with axes and picks and other traditional tools, made the Prophet for every ten from companions forty cubits dig it depth twenty cubits width forty cubits, not six cubits because some runners from people can jump it, let alone fine horses, completed digging in six days on correct. I said Al-Shanqiti differed with others scholars in workers number digging the ditch from Muslims, differed with them in describing the ditch said depth twenty cubits, width forty cubits, not refer source these information I said appeared from scholars' sayings in this summary they not differ in digging the ditch and determining its location and the Prophet and his companions work in it, rather their sayings complete some some and clarify some some, this the ditch the Prophet dug around north Medina fortification for that side in Al-Ahzab battle occurred in Shawwal month year fifth. Al-Khandaq also Yaqut said Al-Khandaq with word the ditch dug around Medina neighborhood large in Jurjan, attributed to it people, from them Abu Tamim Kamil bin Ibrahim Al-Khandaqi Al-Jurjani one presidents, narrated from him Abu Sa'd something from poetry. Al-Khandaq also large village outside Cairo Egypt, said it Thaniyah Al-Asbagh bin Abdul Aziz bin Marwan, attributed to it Abu Imran Musa bin Abdul Rahman Al-Khandaqi then Al-Ramis for his residence Barakah Ramsis from Al-Fustat narrated from Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Ibrahim Al-Muqri known Al-Kirani, narrated from him group, taught Quran period, heard Imam Al-Zaki Abu Muhammad Abdul Azim bin Abdul Qawi bin Abdullah Al-Mundhiri from his companions","Translation":"This story talks about the Prophet digging a trench around Medina during the Battle of the Confederates, peace be upon him.

Al-Bukhari narrated on authority of Ibn Umar (may Allah pleased with them) the Prophet contracted Khaybar half what comes out from it from fruit or crop gave his wives hundred wasq eighty wasq dates twenty wasq barley Umar divided Khaybar chose wives the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) allot for them from water and land or proceed for them some chose land some chose wasq Aisha chose land. Al-Harbi told me Abu Al-Fadl Al-Hasani way Khaybar exit from Medina on upper Ghaba, then take lower Ghaba, then valley called Rajab, then ascend in Naql Barduj - with mosque for the Messenger - then descend in valley called Al-Dumah, with wells, then Al-Ashmudh mountain, then Al-Sa'ah lava, to Namar. Said: said Khaybar limit its beginning Al-Dumah, then become to Khaybar and its fortresses. Said Khaybar market today Al-Martah, Uthman bin Affan established it, the fortress in it remainder people, for Umar bin Al-Khattab, then Wajdah fortress with palms and trees, for the Messenger, then Sulaylim, most for the Prophet, then Al-Ahil: mountain at its base Jews forts, farms and properties known Al-Watih, in it sustenance Prophet's wives and Bani Al-Muttalib and Bani Makhzum, then the valley connected Al-Watih to Tabran and to Khad, all for the Prophet called Al-Katibah and greatest fortress Al-Qamus, opened by hand Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah pleased with him), below it the Prophet's mosque. What between Al-Natah and Al-Shiqq - two valleys - land called Al-Sabkhah. Al-Makhadah connected to greatest the Prophet's mosque, prayed in it forty days his stay all. Told me Al-Hasani Isa bin Musa built it, spent on it great money, called Al-Masjid Al-Manzilah, wide courtyards, on arched arches, prayed in it Eids today, in it the rock prayed towards the Prophet, first Al-Natah. In Al-Natah Marhab fortress and his palace, fell in Zubayr bin Al-Awwam's share, in Al-Shiqq springs told me Al-Hasani spring called Al-Humiyah, named it the Prophet division angels, goes two thirds its water in channel, third in channel, entrance one, told me considered since the Messenger time to today throw in it three woods go two woods in channel throw three dung go two dung in this, one in this, no one able take from it more than third Said to me Abu Al-Fadl Al-Hasani I considered it stood in it to return water to side goes in it third overcame me water, until almost overflow not able that left it. Greatest spring in Al-Natah called Al-Lahihah, between Medina and Khaybar three days. a. h. Al-Bakri similar what Al-Harbi said added: first house opened in Khaybar Bani Qimah house, in Al-Natah, it which Aisha said not satiated the Messenger from barley bread and dates until opened Bani Qimah house. Correct all what quoted from Al-Sukuni's book. a. h. Muhammad bin Ishaq said then stayed the Messenger in Medina when returned from Al-Hudaybiyyah Dhu Al-Hijjah and some Al-Muharram, governed that Hajj polytheists, then went out in remaining Al-Muharram to Khaybar. Ibn Hisham said appointed on Medina Numaylah bin Abdullah Al-Laythi, gave the flag to Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah pleased with him) white. Ibn Ishaq said the Messenger when went out from Medina to Khaybar took on Asr, built for him in it mosque, then on Al-Sahba, then approached the Messenger his army until descended in valley called Al-Raji', descended between them and Ghatfan, to prevent between them and aid Khaybar people, were their allies on the Messenger. Approached the Messenger properties takes them property property, opens them fortress fortress, first its fortresses opened Na'im fortress, there killed Muhammad bin Maslamah, thrown on him from it mill killed him, then Al-Qamus Bani Abi Al-Huqayq fortress, afflicted the Messenger from them captives, from them Safiyyah bint Huyayy bin Akhtab, was with Kinanah bin Al-Rabi' bin Abi Al-Huqayq. Ibn Ishaq when the Messenger opened from their fortresses what opened and possessed from properties what possessed, ended to their two fortresses Al-Watih and Al-Sulalim, last Khaybar fortresses opening, besieged them the Messenger some ten night Ibn Hisham said slogan companions the Messenger day Khaybar O Mansur, kill. kill. Ibn Ishaq told me Abdullah bin Sahl bin Abdul Rahman bin Sahl, brother Bani Harithah, from Jabir bin Abdullah, said went out Marhab the Jew from their fortress, gathered his weapon reciting: Knew Khaybar I Marhab weapon bearer hero experienced I stab sometimes and sometimes strike when lions approached fighting my protection for protected not approached. Answered him Ka'b bin Malik said: Knew Khaybar I Ka'b reliever distress bold stubborn when war blazed followed by war with me sword like lightning sharp in hand decisive not in it blame we tread you until stubborn submits we give penalty or yield plunder by hand advancing no deviation Ibn Hisham recited for me Abu Zayd Al-Ansari: Knew Khaybar I Ka'b and I when war blazes advancing on horror bold stubborn with me sword like lightning sharp in hand decisive not in it blame we crush you until stubborn submits Ibn Hisham and Marhab from Himyar. Ibn Ishaq told me Abdullah bin Sahl, from Jabir bin Abdullah Al-Ansari said the Messenger said who for this? Said Muhammad bin Maslamah I for it O Messenger, I by Allah the bereaved avenger, killed my brother yesterday said rise to him, O Allah aid him on him, said when neared one to other entered between them Umariyah tree from Ushr trees, each took shelter by it from other, whenever sheltered by it from him cut other with his sword what below from it, until emerged each to other, became between them like standing man, no branch in it, then charged Marhab on Muhammad bin Maslamah struck him, avoided with the shield, fell his sword in it, stuck by it held it struck him Muhammad bin Maslamah until killed him. Ibn Ishaq then went out after Marhab his brother Yasir reciting who duels? Claimed Hisham bin Urwah Al-Zubayr bin Al-Awwam went out to Yasir, his mother Safiyyah bint Abdul Muttalib said kills my son O Messenger? Said rather your son kills him if Allah wills, went out Al-Zubayr met fought killed him Al-Zubayr. Narrated Ibn Ishaq on authority of Salmah bin Amr bin Al-Akwa' said sent the Messenger Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq (may Allah pleased with him) with his flag, white, to some Khaybar fortresses, fought returned not opened, effort then sent next day Umar bin Al-Khattab fought, then returned not opened, effort, the Messenger said: I give the flag tomorrow man loves Allah and his Messenger opens Allah on his hands, not fleeing, said: says Salmah, called the Messenger Ali (peace upon him), ophthalmic spat in his eye, then said take this flag proceed by it until Allah opens on you. Said: says Salmah went by Allah by it hurries hurry, we behind him follow his trace, until planted his flag in heap stones under the fortress, looked to him Jew from fortress head, said: Who you? Said I Ali bin Abi Talib said: the Jew ascended, what revealed on Moses, or as said. Said not returned until Allah opened on his hands Ibn Ishaq when finished the Messenger from Khaybar turned to Wadi Al-Qura, besieged its people nights, then turned returning to Medina. Al-Waqidi Jews Khaybar not think the Messenger raids them for their prevention and fortresses and weapons and number, went out every day ten thousand fighters rows then say Muhammad raids us? Far, far, who in Medina from Jews say when the Prophet prepared to Khaybar what safest by Allah Khaybar from you, if saw Khaybar and its fortresses and men returned before reach them, towering fortresses in mountains peaks, water in them fruits, in Khaybar thousand armed, not Asad and Ghatfan prevent from all Arabs except by them so you able Khaybar? Made insinuate that to the Prophet's companions, companions the Prophet say Allah promised his prophet ghanimah it, blinded Allah them exit except guess until descended the Messenger their courtyards night.... said went out the Messenger from Medina took Thaniyah Al-Wada', then took Al-Zaghabah, then ascended Naqmi, then took Al-Mustanakh, then Kabas Al-Watih, with them two guides from Ashja' one called Husayl bin Kharijah, other Abdullah bin Nu'aym, went out on Asr with mosque, then on Al-Sahba... prayed Asr by it, stayed until Maghrib prayed with people, then prayed Isha with people, then called the guides came Husayl bin Kharijah Al-Ashja'i, and Abdullah bin Nu'aym Al-Ashja'i, the Messenger said to Husayl proceed before us until take us valleys' heads, until come Khaybar from between it and Levant, prevent between them and Levant between their alliance from Ghatfan, said Husayl I take you... went out the guide with the Messenger until ended by, takes between Hayad and Al-Sarir, followed valleys' heads until descended by Al-Kharsah, then rose by until took between Al-Shiqq and Al-Natah. When the Messenger overlooked Khaybar said companions stop, then said say O Allah Lord heavens and what shaded Lord seven earths and what bore Lord winds what scattered, we ask you good this village, and good its people, and good what in it, seek refuge with you from its evil and evil what in it. Then said enter on Allah's blessing, marched until ended Al-Manzilah, camped by it hour from night. When descended the Messenger their courtyard not moved that night, until sun rose, morninged their hearts flutter, opened their fortresses with them shovels and picks and baskets when looked to the Messenger descended their courtyard said Muhammad and the army, turned fleeing until returned to their fortresses, the Messenger began say Allah greater, ruined Khaybar, we when descend courtyard people evil morning the warned then the Messenger said: fight them this day and from then took fight them open their fortresses, fortress fortress until opened all. Going out the Prophet from Medina to Khaybar in Safar year seven said went out crescent Rabi' Al-Awwal to Khaybar The Messenger when opened Khaybar asked him Jews said O Muhammad we owners palms and knowledge people by it, irrigated the Messenger Khaybar on half from dates and crop was cultivate under palms the Messenger said I settle you what Allah settles remained in the Messenger covenant until died, and Abu Bakr, and beginning Umar's caliphate. Reached Umar (may Allah pleased with him) the Messenger said in his illness died in not gather in Arabian peninsula two religions, Umar bin Al-Khattab searched about that until found registration from not accused, sent to Hijaz Jews said who from you has covenant from the Prophet (PBUH), I expel him, for Allah Almighty permitted their expulsion, expelled Umar Hijaz Jews. Prolonged Al-Waqidi in his talk about Khaybar conquest, talked about it inclusive talk from all sides, not accommodate our this place to fulfill all came in it Yaqut said Khaybar the place mentioned in the Prophet's expedition (PBUH), area on eight stations from Medina for who intends Levant, applied this name on the district includes this district seven fortresses and farms and many palms, its fortresses names: Na'im fortress, Al-Qamus Abi Al-Huqayq fortress, Al-Shiqq fortress, Al-Natah fortress, Al-Sulalim fortress, Al-Watih fortress, Al-Katibah fortress, as for word Khaybar in Jews language the fortress, for this spot includes these fortresses named Khayabir, conquered the Prophet all year seven Hijrah said year eight. Muhammad bin Musa Al-Khwarizmi raided it the Prophet when passed six years and three months and one and twenty days Hijrah, Ahmad bin Jabir said opened Khaybar year seven by force besieged them near month then reconciled on sparing their blood and leaving progeny, on vacate between Muslims and land and yellow and white and clothing except what on bodies, not conceal him anything then said O Messenger we by building and standing on palms knowledge settle us, settled them contracted them on half dates and grain, said settle you what Allah settles, when Umar bin Al-Khattab's caliphate (may Allah pleased with him) appeared in them adultery and tamper with Muslims expelled them to Levant, divided Khaybar between who had share in it from Muslims, made for Prophet's wives share said which you wishes took the date which wishes took the estate was for her and her offspring. Only did Umar (may Allah pleased with him) that because heard the Messenger said not gather two religions in Arabs peninsula, expelled them... Abu Al-Qasim Al-Zujaji mentioned named by Khaybar bin Qaniyah bin Mahla'il bin Iram bin Abil, Abil brother Ad bin Aws bin Iram bin Sam bin Noah (peace upon him) Khaybar described with fever, poet said: As if by him when came Khaybariyyah visits him its rose and boredom Al-Akhnas bin Shihab said: To Ibnat Hitan bin Qays homes as title embroidered in the sheet writer Stayed by it bare and feel fever as afflicted feverish in Khaybar enduring Also described with many palms and dates, Hassan bin Thabit said: Boast cotton wearing it and may wear Abyssinians robe shortened So not be like the howler accept his neck not feared arrow from bows sharp We and who guides poems towards us like buyer dates to Khaybar land. Hamad Al-Jasir talked about Khaybar said Khaybar from most fertile oases peninsula, located in meeting valleys descend from volcanic mountains chain called Al-Harrat, waters these valleys seep in low depression from land become flowing springs called springs, on these springs courses palms gardens in wide land, from that land seep many waters become swamps grow in it parasitic plants not benefited from, but be shelter for mosquitoes causes in this oasis fever disease (malaria). About idea connection Hebrews Jews with Khaybar said: connection early ones emphasize it strongly like that in many peninsula places Islam came and from its inhabitants who professes Judaism, but Judaism at early ones and in fact not applied on race but means who characterized by attribute i.e. Judaism may apply on non Jews race and mean by it who professes Jewish religion whatever his race, perhaps what clarifies that knowledge Yemeni tribes migrated to peninsula north settled it in Yathrib and Fadak and Khaybar, Arab origin and origin, as for religion relative to these tribes secondary matter. Oasis Khaybar located in wide land, surrounded by lavas and many valleys fertile pastures and multiple springs, inhabited before Islam emergence Ghatfan tribe with many branches, became this tribe's influence dominant on the oasis and what adjacent, became those who live settlement and civilization life subject to tribes influence, more than that not able live except their protection, hence known Khaybar oasis inhabitants their strong connection with Ghatfan tribe. As for their origin was mixed blend from civilized tribes from it what returns to deep Yemeni origin civilization, from it what returns to newcomers pushed them livelihood profession first, then pushed them strength and control factors to migrate to these lands, inhabited the oasis exploited its goods habitation and investment linked closest link with Ghatfan tribe's power protecting the oasis, find in it fertile pasture and thriving markets for merchandise all what those tribes need from weapons and clothing and fruits store them long time for need. Islam came all who resides in agricultural oases dependent on Ghatfan tribe's protection, not all who resides in it from distant Arabs but Arabs in many morals and dealings, but from them pure lineage in that, as find in Marhab the Jew registered Arab books side from his heroism he not Jewish lineage but from Himyar Qahtaniyyah pure lineage, as clarified Ibn Hisham the Arab scholar Himyari lineage had said Marhab from Himyar. As for Jews settlement the oasis oldest what known from Arabs historians Moses bin Imran the prophet sent expedition to Hijaz for fighting Amaleq, ordered them not spare anyone, but spared young boy returned by, was they settled in Hijaz regions. Perhaps spread Mosaic religion in this oasis from effect what carried on belief that inhabitants relate by lineage to Jews. No doubt exists between inhabitants from merchants and craftsmen Jews, but saying they had influence and power and control enabled them expel its older inhabitants and seize it, from what not support strong authentic historical texts. Ibn Khaldun said then Joshua from Israelites sent to Hijaz conquered it, seized from Amaleq hands its kingdom, seized Yathrib and its lands and Khaybar. What supports mind and logic Khaybar agricultural oasis ancient antiquity not possible determine definitively its people before Islam emergence like other from agricultural oases inhabitants in peninsula, live life closer to settlement and calm than to any kind lives live peoples. They in most cases mixture from all races, old inhabitants known by these lands since known, unknown their origin, and tribes from Arabs tired Bedouin life for reason from reasons, preferred way live in this oasis closer to calm from Bedouin life, and merchants found in this oasis all what trader desires from material profit, its annual general market flocks to it Arab tribes from various peninsula parts every year. I said this excerpts summary from what historians mentioned about Khaybar the town the Messenger conquered (PBUH) as for in this era Khaybar became populous town taking its share from urban and civilizational progress, like that in that like other towns in Saudi Arabia kingdom, linked all its administrative and social affairs with Medina administration. Khaybar like previous village in Bisha valley shore western its inhabitants Al-Mani' from Aklab tribe, subordinate to Bisha administration.","Translation":"The story talks about Khaibar city conquered by Muslims under the Prophet Muhammad's leadership, peace be upon him. Historical texts indicate Khaibar was an ancient agricultural oasis inhabited by Jews practicing trade and agriculture. After Islamic conquest, Khaibar became part of modern Saudi Arabia, managed administratively and socially within Medina's administration."},{"Place":"Khif Bani Kinanah","City":"Makkah Al-Mukarramah","Description":"A place upper Mecca the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) descends. Al-Bukhari narrated on authority of Abu Hurayrah Allah said: The Prophet said next day sacrifice day he in Mina we descending tomorrow in Khif Bani Kinanah where divided on disbelief means that Al-Muhassab that because Quraish and Kinanah allied on Bani Hashim and Bani Abdul Muttalib or Bani Al-Muttalib not intermarry them and sell them until surrender to them the Prophet (PBUH). In narration the Messenger said when intended Mecca arrival our home tomorrow if Allah wills by Khif Bani Kinanah where divided on disbelief. Yaqut said Khif with fathah first and sukun second, ending fa, Khif what descended from mountain thickness and rose above water course, Ibn Jani said Khif origin difference, that descended from mountain not summit nor low so opposes them from it people Akhiaf i.e. different, said: People Akhiaf and various in morals all them gathers leather house. Qadi Iyadh said Khif Bani Kinanah Al-Muhassab, thus interpreted in Abdul Razzaq's hadith, Bat'ha Mecca, said beginning Al-Abtah, truth in it because origin what flattened from the valley and widened, Al-Zuhri said: Khif the valley Khif what sidelined from water path right and left spacious. a. h. Al-Bakri said Khif with fathah first and sukun second, on fa'l weight name occurs added to many places, not Khif except between two mountains, said: Khif rise and descent in mountain base or thickness most famous Khif Mina, its mosque Khif mosque, Al-Ahwas said in it: Promised you Khif Dha Al-Shara from Mina those promises if we able. Behind Usfan to Janabidh Bani Saifi nineteen miles, before that mile Ibn Dubay' well, before it Al-Qurashi well. From Al-Janabidh to Marr Al-Zahran four miles, after Al-Janabidh mile roughness and difficulty and narrow road between two mountains, said it the place the Messenger ordered Al-Abbas detain Abu Sufyan until armies pass. Narrated on authority of Ibn Abbas said when the Messenger descended Marr Al-Zahran, was from Abu Sufyan's story what was that night the Messenger said to Al-Abbas when Abu Sufyan converted (depart O Abbas, detain him at mountain's Khatm at valley's narrow until Allah's soldiers pass on him). I said by this likely narration (mountain's Khatm) most correct narrations this news, indicates narrations context on two meanings: one and most likely intended by it mountain's nose overlooking narrow from the valley pass from it armies the Messenger, then becomes this place name. As for other meaning - came in narration Khatm Al-Khayl - they said intended by horses' Khatm tightening their reins at crowding in valley's narrow when pass by. Al-Khandaq: Medina, dotted kha with fathah and single noon sakinah and undotted dal with fathah, ending dotted qaf: ditch the Messenger (PBUH) dug year Al-Ahzab for what reached him Bani Al-Nadir from Jews on Quraish and their alliance with them, fearing on the Messenger (PBUH) and his companions, that after their expulsion from Medina, came for war, then Huyayy bin Akhtab worked until cut alliance between Qurayzah and the Prophet (PBUH), siege intensified on Muslims hypocrisy appeared, Almighty said: (When they came to you from above you) (Surah Al-Ahzab verse 10), meaning Qurayzah (and from below you) meaning Asad and Ghatfan, were descending what between end Wadi Al-Naqmi to its end, Quraish and Kinanah seeing, dug (PBUH) length from upper Wadi Bathan west the valley with the lava to west Eid prayer place today, then to Al-Fath mosque then to two mountains (small) west the valley, made Muslims their backs to Sal' mountain, struck the Prophet his tent on place Al-Fath mosque today, the ditch between them and polytheists, finished digging after six days, worked in it all Muslims they that day three thousand, stayed in expedition the ditch fifteen days, said twenty four days, returned to Medina. The ditch effaced its trace today not remain in it thing known except its side, because Bathan valley overtook the ditch place became its flood on the ditch place. a. h. Ibn Hisham said group from Jews from Bani Al-Nadir and others who gathered the parties on the Messenger, went out until came to Quraish Mecca, called them to war the Messenger, said we with you on him until eradicate him, when said that to Quraish pleased them and motivated them what called them to from war the Messenger, gathered for that and prepared for it, went out those Jews until came Ghatfan from Qays Aylan, called them to war the Messenger, informed them they with them on him, Quraish followed them on that, gathered with them in it. Ibn Ishaq said went out Quraish, leader Abu Sufyan bin Harb, went out Ghatfan leader Ibn Husayn, in Bani Fazarah and Al-Harith bin Awf Al-Murri, in Bani Murrah, and Mis'ar bin Rukhaylah bin Nuwayrah bin Ghatfan in who followed from his people from Ashja'. When heard by them the Messenger what gathered for him from matter, struck the ditch on Medina, worked in it the Messenger motivating Muslims for reward, worked with him Muslims in it. Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah intensified on them in some the ditch boulder, complained it to the Messenger, called for vessel water, spat in it, then prayed what Allah willed pray by, then sprinkled that water on that boulder, says who attended it by who sent him with truth, crumbled until became like dune not repel axe nor shovel. When finished the Messenger from the ditch approached Quraish until descended at meeting torrents, from Ruma, between Al-Jurf and Zaghabah, in ten thousand from their Abyssinians and who followed from Bani Kinanah and Tihamah people, approached Ghatfan and who followed from Najd people, until descended Dhunb Naqmi, beside Uhud. Went out the Messenger and Muslims, until made their backs to Sal', in three thousand from Muslims, struck there his camp the ditch between him and the people. Appointed on Medina Ibn Umm Maktum, ordered children and women made in forts. Intensified there affliction, intensified fear, came their enemy from above them and from below them, until believers thought every thought, hypocrisy appeared from some hypocrites, stayed the Messenger and stayed on him polytheists some twenty night, near month, not war between them except arrows shooting and siege. Ibn Hisham said said Salman the Persian suggested it - the ditch - to the Messenger, said narrated to me some knowledge people Muhajirun day the ditch said Salman from us, Ansar said Salman from us, the Messenger said: Salman from us household. Al-Suhayli said digging the ditch not Arabs' habit, but Persians' stratagems and wars, therefore Salman the Persian suggested it, first who ditched ditches from Persians kings what Al-Tabari mentioned Manushahr bin Abirj bin Afridun. Al-Suhayli said then Nu'aym bin Mas'ud bin Amir bin Unayf Tha'labah bin Qanfudh bin Hilal bin Khulawah bin Ashja' bin Rayth bin Ghatfan, came the Messenger said O Messenger I converted my people not know my conversion, order me what you wish, the Messenger said (you in us man one, weaken about us if able for war deception)... went out until came Bani Qurayzah : then went out until came Quraish ... then went out until came Ghatfan worked between them division until slackened some from some, sent Allah on them wind in winter nights cold severe cold, began overturn their pots and throw their buildings, then said Abu Sufyan O Quraish people you by Allah not became residence place, perished the pasturage and light, Bani Qurayzah betrayed us, reached us from them what we hate, met from wind severity what you see, not settle for us pot, nor stand for us fire, nor hold for us building, depart for I departing, then stood to his camel hobbled, sat on it, then struck it jumped with it on three, by Allah not untie its hobble except standing. Al-Waqidi said Salman O Messenger we when in Persia land and fear horses ditched on us, perhaps O Messenger you ditch? Liked Salman's opinion Muslims ... rode the Messenger horse with him group from his companions from Muhajirun and Ansar sought place descend, most liked descents to him make Sal' behind his back and ditch from Al-Mizad to Dhubab to Ratij, worked that day in the ditch, called people informed them enemy near and their camp to Sal' slope made Muslims work hastening hasten enemy coming on them, the Messenger began work with them in the ditch to motivate Muslims, borrowed from Bani Qurayzah much tools from shovels and picks and baskets, dig by the ditch - they that day peace to the Prophet dislike Quraish coming - appointed the Messenger on each side from the ditch people dig it, Muhajirun digging from Ratij side to Dhubab, Ansar digging from Dhubab to Bani Ubayd mountain, rest Medina connected with building. Youth carrying soil, the ditch width five or so, Muhajirun and Ansar carrying on their heads in baskets, when returned with baskets made in it stones come by from Sal' mountain. Made soil what towards the Prophet and his companions, made stones towards them like date mountains, stones from greatest their weapons throw them by, the Messenger that day carrying soil in baskets throws it, competed people that day in Salman the Persian Muhajirun said Salman from us, strong knowing digging ditches. Ansar said he from us we more entitled him, reached the Messenger their saying said Salman man from us household. Indeed that day worked work ten men until aided him that day Qays bin Abi Sa'sa'ah, delayed him, asked the Messenger said order him perform wudu for him, bathe by it, overturn the vessel behind him, did as if released from bond. Narrated on authority of Jabir bin Abdullah said indeed saw Salman that day, made for him five cubits length and five in ground, not wait him until finished alone, says O Allah no living except afterlife living. Not in Muslims that day one except digs in the ditch or carries soil, indeed seen the Messenger and Abu Bakr and Umar - Abu Bakr and Umar not separate in work nor travel nor home - carrying soil in their clothes that day from haste, if not find baskets for Muslims haste The ditch what between Bani Ubayd mountain Khuzbi to Ratij, for Muhajirun from Dhubab to Ratij, for Ansar what between Dhubab to Khuzbi this what dug the Messenger and Muslims connected Medina with building from every side it like fortress. Al-Mutri said the Messenger dug length from upper Wadi Bathan west the valley, with the lava to west Eid prayer place, then to Al-Fath mosque then to two small mountains in west the valley called one Ratij other Bani Ubayd mountain, made Muslims their backs to Sal' mountain struck the Messenger his tent on the peak in west Sal' mountain... the ditch between them and polytheists, effaced trace the ditch today not remain from it thing except its side, because the valley Wadi Bathan overtook on the ditch place became its course in the ditch place. Ibn Al-Najjar said the ditch today remaining in it canal comes from Quba spring to palms at bottom Medina by Al-Sayh around Al-Fath mosque, in the ditch palms buried most and walls collapsed Ahmad Al-Abbasi concludes from what Al-Tabarani and Al-Bayhaqi and Ibn Sa'd narrated the Prophet drew the ditch from Ajmah Al-Shaykhayn end Bani Harithah behind Bani Abdul Ashhal, i.e. end eastern lava until reached Al-Mizad passed Bani Salimah homes towards Al-Fath mosque and Bani Ubayd mountain, there western lava, then cut forty cubits for every ten, Muhajirun and Ansar disputed in Salman the Persian, the Prophet said (from us household) Muhajirun from Ratij side to Dhubab Ansar digging from Dhubab to Bani Salimah homes Bani Ubayd mountain, result the ditch northern Medina from end eastern lava to end western lava... one Medina sides exposed rest sides connected with building and palms enemy not able from it. a. h. The ditch effaced its trace today not remain from it thing known except its side, because Wadi Bathan overtook on the ditch places became its flood the ditch place. Al-Shanqiti said the ditch considered from military plans Muslims Arabs preceded to work it, since Medina surrounded with natural fortifications from its east and south and west what surrounds it from rough lavas, no ambition for armies in crossing it, with what intersperses it from villages and farms and palms what scatters and disperses any army thinks coming from it, but northern side military entrance exposed not fortified, not invaded Medina over ages except from it, invaded it Tuba' from there... as came from it polytheists in Uhud battle, tried attack from it in Al-Ahzab battle, therefore necessary fortify this side, fortified it the Chosen (PBUH) with the ditch, dug it from end eastern lava at Ajmah Al-Shaykhayn east what known now as Al-Mustarah mosque, until slope Bani Salimah lava to east from Al-Qiblatayn, length (2725) meters, in arc open shape, worked in it thousand and five hundred from Muslims, with axes and picks and other traditional tools, made the Prophet for every ten from companions forty cubits dig it depth twenty cubits width forty cubits, not six cubits because some runners from people can jump it, let alone fine horses, completed digging in six days on correct. I said Al-Shanqiti differed with others scholars in workers number digging the ditch from Muslims, differed with them in describing the ditch said depth twenty cubits, width forty cubits, not refer source these information I said appeared from scholars' sayings in this summary they not differ in digging the ditch and determining its location and the Prophet and his companions work in it, rather their sayings complete some some and clarify some some, this the ditch the Prophet dug around north Medina fortification for that side in Al-Ahzab battle occurred in Shawwal month year fifth.

Bukhari narrated from Anas bin Malik that a man entered the mosque on Friday from a door towards Dar al-Qada' while the Messenger of Allah was standing delivering the sermon, faced him standing and said: O Messenger of Allah, the properties are destroyed and the roads are cut off, so invoke Allah to send rain on us. The Prophet raised his hands and said: O Allah, send rain on us, O Allah, send rain on us - the hadith. Yaqut said: Dar al-Qada' is the house of Marwan bin al-Hakam in Medina, was for Umar bin al-Khattab, sold to pay his debt after death. Some claimed it was the Emirate house in Medina, possible as it became for the Emir of Medina. That's the text of what al-Majd said in al-Maghanim. Ibn Shabbah said: Abdul Aziz bin Marwan said: Among them is Dar al-Qada' which is today a courtyard for the mosque of the Messenger of Allah in its west towards Dar Marwan. Abu Ghassan said: Abdul Aziz informed me from Rashid bin Hafs from Umm al-Hakam bint Abdullah bin Thabit from her aunt Sahlah bint Asim: Dar al-Qada' was for Abd al-Rahman bin Awf - named Dar al-Qada' because Abd al-Rahman secluded himself there during the days of consultation until the matter was decided, sold by Banu Abd al-Rahman bin Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan. Abdul Aziz said: It became in the endowments, with the divans and treasury there, demolished by Abu al-Abbas the Commander of the Faithful, made a courtyard for the mosque, as it is today. He said: I heard others say otherwise, including Muhammad bin Ismail bin Abi Fudayk from his uncle: The courtyard of al-Qada' was for Umar bin al-Khattab, ordered Hafsa and Abdullah his children to sell it at his death for his debt, if its price covers the debt, otherwise ask Banu Adi bin Ka'b to pay it. They sold it to Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan, called Dar al-Qada'. Ibn Abi Fudayk said: I heard Umar say it was called Dar al-Qada'. Muawiyah bought it during his governorship until Ziyad bin Abdullah came to Medina in 138 AH, demolished it, made it a courtyard for the mosque, opened the door next to the small gate, and imposed its demolition on the market people. Muhammad bin Ismail bin Abi Fudayk said: He took four dawaniq from me for its demolition. Ibn Abi Fudayk informed me also - as my uncle informed me - Abdullah bin Umar bin Ubayd Allah bin Abdullah bin Umar said, and Ubayd Allah pointed to a chest in his house and said: In this chest are receipts from those, Allah knows best about it. Al-Samhudi spoke of Dar al-Qada', cited what Ibn Shabbah mentioned textually, and added: Ibn Zabalah narrated the first news of Ibn Abi Fudayk abbreviated from Muhammad bin Ismail meaning Ibn Abi Fudayk from Ibn Umar that Umar died leaving 28,000 debt, called Abdullah and Hafsa and said: I took from Abdullah a stain, and I like to meet Allah without it on my neck, so sell for it until you pay it, if my wealth is insufficient, ask Banu Adi, if enough, don't exceed Quraysh. Abdullah bin Umar went to Muawiyah and sold Umar's house called Dar al-Qada', and his property in al-Ghabah, paid his debt, so it was called Dar Qada' Din Umar, the courtyard of al-Qada'. Muhammad bin Ismail said: Ziyad bin Ubayd Allah demolished Dar al-Qada' when he was governor for Abu al-Abbas in Medina in 138 AH, rented from Medina merchants, demolished it, made it a courtyard for the mosque, opened the door next to the gate. I say: This is what historians mentioned about Dar al-Qada' - locating it and reason for naming - they didn't differ in naming reason or location. We notice in what Ibn Shabbah cited difference between attributing it to Abd al-Rahman bin Awf or Umar bin al-Khattab, but what prevails in narrations is it was Umar bin al-Khattab's house. This house after demolition became a courtyard for the Prophet's mosque, its location no longer known in this era, no mention left except in history pages.","Translation":"This story talks about Dar Al-Qada' in Medina, known by this name because sold to pay Umar bin Al-Khattab's debts after death. Narrations differed on its true owner; some indicate Abdul Rahman bin Awf or Uthman bin Affan's house, while others confirm Umar bin Al-Khattab's ownership. Over ages, the house demolished and turned into a courtyard for the Prophet's Mosque. This house's site no longer known in current era, but remains part of Medina's history pages."},{"Place":"Daskarah","City":"Homs","Description":"In what Bukhari narrated from Ibn Abbas from Abi Sufyan bin Harb - in the long hadith of Abi Sufyan with Heraclius king of Rome, at the end: Heraclius permitted the Roman nobles in his daskarah in Homs, ordered its doors closed then looked - the hadith. In al-Taj: Daskarah, al-Saghani said: the village, al-Azhari said: daskarah is the hermitage from Abu Amr, in Jami' al-Qazaz: daskarah is the flat land, or daskarah is the houses of non-Arabs with drink and amusements, al-Akhtal said: In front of a daskarah around it olives ripen. Al-Akhfash said: The correct is the verse for Yazid bin Muawiyah, Ibn al-Sayd claimed for Abi Dahbal, or al-Ahwas, or daskarah is a building like a palace with houses and residences for servants and retinue, as in al-Mughith in Gharib al-Hadith for Abu Musa, al-Layth said: for kings, and like in Jami' al-Qiraz, plural daskakir, not pure Arabic. In the hadith of Abi Sufyan and Heraclius narrated by Bukhari at the beginning of Sahih and in between several times that he permitted nobles in his daskarah. I say: I didn't find in references I reviewed specifying Heraclius' daskarah relative to Homs city, no mention except in the hadith narrated by Bukhari from Ibn Abbas - mentioned earlier. This name is shared, Yaqut mentioned in his Mu'jam several places named this: Al-Daskarah with open first, silent second, open kaf: large village with pulpit in Nahar al-Malik west of Baghdad, attributed to Abu Mansur bin Ahmad bin al-Husayn bin Mansur al-Daskari one of the leaders, Abu Sa'd narrated poetry from him.

Bukhari narrated from al-Zuhri: I entered on Anas bin Malik in Damascus while he was crying, I said: What makes you cry? He said: I don't know anything I knew except this prayer, and this prayer has been wasted. Yaqut said: Damascus al-Sham with broken first, open second, thus majority narrated, broken is dialect, shin dotted, last qaf. Famous town, capital of al-Sham, garden of earth without dispute; best architecture, freshness of spot, abundance of fruit, pleasant area, abundance of waters, existence of needs.

Sira people said: Named after Damascus bin Qani bin Malik bin Arfakhshad bin Sam bin Noah peace upon him, this Ibn al-Kalbi's saying, elsewhere: Born Yaqzhan bin Amir Salif and they Salaf, he built Damascus capital. Said: First who built it Bayurasf, said: Damascus built on head of 3145 years from total time they say 7000 years, Abraham the Friend born 5 years after building. Said: Who built Damascus Jayrun bin Sa'd bin Ad bin Iram bin Sam bin Noah peace upon him, named it Iram of pillars. Said: Hud peace upon him descended Damascus, founded the wall in south of its mosque. Said: Lazarus servant of Abraham peace upon him built Damascus, was Abyssinian given by Nimrod bin Canaan when Abraham exited fire, the boy called Damascus so named after him. Abraham made him over everything, Romans inhabited after. Others said: Named after Damascus bin Nimrod bin Canaan who built it, with him Abraham, pushed to him Nimrod after Allah saved Abraham from fire. Others said: Named after Damascus bin Iram bin Sam bin Noah peace upon him, brother of Palestine, Aelia, Homs, Jordan, each built place named after. Trustworthy Sira people: Adam peace upon him descended in place now Bayt Anat Hawwa in Bayt Lahya, Habil in Muqra, owner of sheep, Qabil in Qaninah owner of crop, these places around Damascus. At place now Bab al-Sa'at near mosque huge rock where offering placed, if accepted fire descends burns it, if not remains. Habil brought fat ram placed on rock, fire descended burned it. Qabil brought wheat from his yield placed on rock remained. Qabil envied brother, followed to mountain Qasyun overlooking Damascus spot, wanted to kill him, didn't know how, Satan came took stone hit head, saw took stone hit brother's head killed on Qasyun mountain. I saw there stone with like blood, Sham people claim it's stone killed with, redness on it Habil's blood trace, before it cave visited beautiful called cave of blood for that, saw in mountain side known as Qasyun mountain. They said in Allah's saying: {And We gave them refuge on a hillock, a place of security and running springs} [Quran 23:50] it is Damascus with security and abundance of living and springs abundant water. Qatadah said in {By the fig} mountain on Damascus, {and the olive} mountain on Jerusalem, {and Mount Sinai} pleasant valley, {and this secure city} Mecca. Said: Iram of pillars Damascus. Al-Asma'i: Gardens of world three: Ghutah Damascus, river Balkh, river Ubullah. World's dumps three: Ubullah, Siraf, Oman. Abu Bakr Muhammad bin al-Abbas al-Khwarizmi poet scholar: Gardens of world four: Ghutah Damascus, Sughd Samarkand, Sha'b Bawan, Ubullah island, saw all, best Damascus. News: Abraham peace upon him born in Ghutah Damascus in village Barzah in Qasyun mountain. From Prophet peace upon him: Jesus peace upon him descends at white minaret east of Damascus. Yaqut: Among Damascus specifics I didn't see in other town like it, abundance of rivers, water flow in channels, rare pass wall without water exiting tube to basin drink from, arriving and departing. Didn't see mosque, school, khanqah without water flowing in pond in courtyard, pouring in ablution place. Houses crowded for population abundance, dwellers, narrow spot. Suburb outside wall surrounding most town size of town itself. In flat land surrounded all sides by towering mountains, Qasyun mountain no place with more worshippers, many caves, caverns, prophets' and righteous traces not found elsewhere. Good excellent fruits transported around from Egypt to Harran nearby benefit all. Poets described much. Mosque proverb for beauty. Sum: Paradise not described without like in Damascus. Impossible seek worldly matters major minor without found in all towns. Muslims opened in Rajab 14 AH. Its mosque some Damascus people described: Mosque of beauties, complete wonders, counted one of wonders, furnished some carpets marble, best composition and order, above equal sizes, craftsmanship harmonious. Carpet almost drips gold, ignites fire, free from animal images to plant types and branches kinds, but not picked except by eyes, no corruption enters as enters trees fruits, lasting over time perceptible by sight every time, no thirst touches without rain, no wilting with time turns. Said: Wonders of world four: Sanjah bridge, Alexandria lighthouse, Edessa church, Damascus mosque. Built by al-Walid bin Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, zealous in mosque building. Start building 87 AH, or 88 AH. When wanted build gathered Damascus Christians said: We want add to our mosque your church give you church where want or double price, refused brought Khalid bin al-Walid's letter and covenant said: We find in our books no one demolishes without strangled. Al-Walid said: I first demolish it, stood yellow qaba' demolished, people demolished, added to mosque what wanted, exerted utmost possible. Yaqut spoke extensively about Damascus, its geography, mosque, inhabitants from companions and followers, Muslim notables, famous scholars, hadith narrators, talk not fit this place, others historians prolonged for who wants exhaust Damascus history. In al-Rawd al-Mu'attar al-Himyari said: Damascus capital of al-Sham, Umayyad kingdom house. Named after builder Damascus bin Qani bin Malik bin Arfakhshad bin Sam bin Noah peace upon him, or after Damascus bin Nimrod bin Canaan. Ayad said: Broken dal open mim, some break mim. It is of pillars in Awf bin Khalid and Ukrimah saying and others, or otherwise. Ujam historians: In Ayyar month Damascusush king built Julq city Damascus, dug Barada river, carved in mountain till flowed to city. Damascus wall mud, four doors: Western Jabiyah door, southern Toma door today Bab al-Masadimah, eastern Ghutah door, Khalid bin al-Walid entered from it conquered Damascus, northern Faradis door Kaysan door. River surrounds city every side till meets Ghutah side. At Toma door four rivers: Barzah, Thawra, Yazid, al-Qanat, flow in city till reach Faradis door mile to Ayn Haran, three monasteries, Ibn Tulun palace beside. Adjacent western Jabiyah door Musalla, flow from city in orchards to Bab Saghir above five monk towers. Damascus wall openings like doors rivers enter city flow inside cross houses markets, markets all roofed like Damascus mosque roofs, ground paved. Its mosque built by al-Walid bin Abd al-Malik 88, inside city, no on earth like building or better description or firmer perfection or more wondrous gilding with gold types mosaics, rubbed bricks, polished marble. I say: Owner al-Rawd and other historians prolonged about Damascus city and mosque, detailed building and description, but our place not accommodate all historians said. As for conquest: Al-Baladhuri said: When Muslims finished fighting gathered in al-Marj, stayed 15 nights, returned to Damascus city 14 nights left Muharram 14 AH. Took Ghutah and churches by force, people fortified closed gate. Khalid bin al-Walid camped at eastern gate with about 5000 Abu Ubaydah added, some say Khalid was leader, removal came besieging Damascus, monastery camped Khalid called Dayr Khalid. Amr bin al-As at Toma gate, Shurahbil at Faradis gate, Abu Ubaydah at Jabiyah gate, Yazid bin Abi Sufyan at small gate to Kaysan gate, Abu al-Darda' Uwaimir bin Amir al-Khazraji at Birzah guard. Bishop who hosted Khalid sometimes stood on wall called Khalid, greeted conversed. One day said: O Abu Sulayman your matter advancing, promise me, make peace with this city. Khalid called ink paper wrote: In name Allah Merciful Compassionate, this what Khalid bin al-Walid gave Damascus people when entered: Gave security on selves, properties, churches, city wall not demolished nor houses inhabited. For them Allah's covenant, Prophet's protection peace upon him, caliphs, believers. Not approached except good if give jizyah. Then bishop's companion came Khalid one night informed tonight feast for city people, busy, eastern gate blocked stones left, advised seek ladder, people from monastery near camp brought two ladders, group Muslims climbed to wall top, descended to gate only man or two, cooperated opened. At dawn. Abu Ubaydah struggled open Jabiyah gate, ascended group Muslims on wall, Romans fighters poured to his side, fought Muslims fiercely, turned fleeing, Abu Ubaydah and Muslims opened Jabiyah gate by force, entered met at al-Miqalat copper place in Damascus, al-Baris Hassan's mention in poetry: They drink from Baris arrival on them Barada rippling with smooth nectar. Narrated Romans took dead night, surrounded funeral with crowd brave strong, rest poured to gate stand prevent Muslims open enter till companions return burying dead, hoped Muslims negligence. Muslims surprised fought hardest fiercest till opened at sunrise. When bishop saw Abu Ubaydah near entering city hurried Khalid made peace, opened eastern gate. Khalid entered bishop spreading letter wrote. Some Muslims said: By Allah Khalid not leader how peace valid? Abu Ubaydah said: Valid on Muslims lowest, approved peace enforced, didn't regard forced open. Damascus all peace. Abu Ubaydah wrote to Umar sent. Opened city gates all met. Al-Waqidi: Damascus conquest Rajab 14 AH, Khalid's peace letter date Rabi' al-Akhir 15 AH, Khalid wrote without date, when gathered to march to gathered at Yarmouk came bishop asked renew letter witness Abu Ubaydah and Muslims, did registered testimony Abu Ubaydah, Yazid bin Abi Sufyan, Shurahbil bin Hasanah others, dated renewal time. I say: This possible summary Damascus history - Umayyad Islamic state capital - Damascus still prosperous political social status, capital of Syrian Republic in al-Sham this era, fame ancient modern dispenses prolongation about it.","Translation":"This story talks about the famous Damascus city in the Levant, considered earth's paradise as described.

News reached Dawmah people scattered, Prophet descended courtyard found none, stayed days sent raids returned met none, took man asked Prophet: Escaped heard took camels. Prophet offered Islam converted, returned Medina no encounter 10 nights left Rabi' al-Akhir. Narrated from Ibn Umar: Prophet sent Abd al-Rahman bin Awf 700 to Dawmat al-Jandal Sha'ban 6 AH, untied turban hand turbaned black turban let down between shoulders. Came Dawmah called Islam refused thrice, Asbagh bin Amr al-Kalbi converted Christian leader, sent Abd al-Rahman informed Prophet wrote marry Tamadur bint al-Asbagh, married entered her came her mother Abi Salamah bin Abd al-Rahman. Ibn Sa'd: Sent Khalid bin al-Walid 420 cavalry Rajab 9 AH expedition to Ukaydir bin Abd al-Malik Dawmat al-Jandal, between Medina 15 nights. Sent Tabuk expedition, Ukaydir from Kindah ruled, Christian. Khalid reached exited fortress moonlit night wild cows chasing he brother Hassan, Khalid's cavalry charged captured Ukaydir, brother Hassan resisted fought killed, companions escaped fortress. Khalid secured Ukaydir from killing till bring Prophet open Dawmat al-Jandal, did made peace 2000 camels, 800 heads, 400 armors, 400 lances. Separated Prophet's pure share, divided spoils took fifth, divided rest among companions, each five shares. Khalid exited Ukaydir brother Misad fortress what made peace returned Medina. Came Ukaydir Prophet gifted made peace jizyah, secured him brother, let go. Wrote book security what made peace, sealed day with fingernail. I say: This city most famous Jawf cities oldest history, seat administration ages, but Sakakah second Jawf city began emerge rival social urban center, transfer emirate seat Dawmat al-Jandal to Sakakah beginning clear shift both cities. Hamad al-Jasir referred: Dawmat al-Jandal most famous town Jawf, name applied it, capital those lands till 1370 AH when Prince Turki bin Ahmad al-Sudayri emir these lands, transferred capital that era Sakakah, Jawf Dawmat al-Jandal 50 km from Sakakah. I say: After transfer emirate seat passed relative stagnation, but social urban renaissance swept Kingdom regions included, took share, recent years developed noticeably vital facilities, developed security municipal, completed education stages primary intermediate secondary boys girls, modern huge buildings appeared, streets paved, lit electricity, current reached every neighborhood entered every house, old cemeteries walled streets roads groomed, various social facilities available, commercial market established, markets stores built reinforced concrete, commercial movement grew, houses shops prices rose, urban extended expanded areas. Most prominent ancient historical landmarks this city - Marid fortress famous ages still known, Burj fortress traces, Umar mosque stone minaret distinguished stone architectural style. Minaret still standing used call prayer. Exhausted talk this city geographic historical social aspects my book Bilad al-Jawf or Dawmat al-Jandal all aspects, sufficient. Dawmah also: Yaqut said dammah, from Ghutah Damascus villages not Dawmat al-Jandal, thus Madhbubi from Damascenes. From it Abdullah bin Hilal bin al-Furat Abu Abdullah al-Rab'i al-Dawmi al-Damashqi, resided Beirut one ascetics, narrated from Ibrahim bin Ayyub al-Hurani, Ahmad bin Asim al-Antaki, Ahmad bin Abi al-Hawari, Hisham bin Ammar. Narrated from Abu Hatim al-Razi, Abu al-Abbas al-Asam, Muhammad bin al-Mundhir, Shakr al-Harawi, Abu Nu'aym al-Istrabadi, Abd al-Rahman bin Dawud bin Mansur, mentioned Abu al-Qasim. Attributed Dawmah group hadith narrators, Shuja' bin Bakr bin Muhammad Abu Muhammad al-Tamimi al-Dawmi, narrated from Abu Muhammad Hisham bin Muhammad al-Kufi, narrated from Abd al-Aziz al-Kinani.","Translation":"The story of Dumat Al-Jandal talks about historical events the city witnessed since the Prophet Muhammad's time, peace be upon him, to later eras. Initially, an expedition led by Khalid bin Al-Walid to conquer the area, ending capturing its king Ukaydir and sending to the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Reconciliation between Muslims and Ukaydir who converted and agreed to pay tribute."},{"Place":"Dhat al-Jaysh (Mufrahat currently)","City":"Medina","Description":"Place near Medina. Bukhari narrated from Aisha Prophet's wife: We went with Messenger of Allah some travels till Bida' or Dhat al-Jaysh my necklace broke, Messenger stayed seeking it, people stayed, not on water. People came Abu Bakr Siddiq said: See what Aisha did, detained Messenger Allah people not on water no water with. Abu Bakr came Messenger placed head on my thigh sleeping said: Detained Messenger Allah people not on water no water with. Aisha said: Abu Bakr rebuked said what Allah willed, poked hand my side, nothing prevented moving except Messenger Allah on my thigh. Messenger rose morning no water, Allah revealed tayammum verse did tayammum. Usayd bin Hudayr said: Not first your blessing O Abu Bakr family. Sent camel I on, found necklace under. Ibn Hajar: Her saying till Bida' or Dhat al-Jaysh, between Medina Khaybar as Nawawi asserted. I say: What Nawawi asserted opposes what Ibn al-Tin asserted: Bida' Dhu al-Hulayfah near Medina Mecca road, Dhat al-Jaysh beyond Dhu al-Hulayfah Mecca road. Also: Dhat al-Jaysh from Medina post, seven miles between it al-Aqiq, al-Aqiq Mecca road not Khaybar, consistent Ibn al-Tin. Yaqut: Al-Jaysh open silent, Dhat al-Jaysh some made from al-Aqiq Medina, quoted Urwah bin Udhaynah: Almost love day Dhat al-Jaysh kill me for ruined forsaken dwelling no longing shock. Said: First al-Jaysh place near Medina valley between Dhu al-Hulayfah Turban, one Prophet's stations to Badr, one stages return Banu al-Mustaliq raid, there Prophet sought Aisha's necklace, tayammum verse revealed. Ja'far bin al-Zubayr bin al-Awwam said: For ruins Dhat al-Jaysh become ruined old. Became for them morning after wind their caravans separated. Ascended Bida' apparent, grieved heart anxious. Al-Bakri: Dhat al-Jaysh Qutbi mentioned Dhat al-Jaysh post from Medina, Malik narrated from Yahya bin Sa'id: Asked Salim bin Abdullah hardest Ibn Umar delayed Maghrib travel? Sun set Dhat al-Jaysh prayed al-Aqiq. Yahya bin Yahya: Between Dhat al-Jaysh al-Aqiq two miles. Ibn al-Mu'az interpretation from Ibn Wahb: Between Dhat al-Jaysh al-Aqiq five miles, Isa from Ibn al-Qasim between ten miles. Mutarrif: Al-Aqiq three miles from Medina. If look these Qutbi's saying correct Ibn al-Qasim. Al-Mutri: Dhat al-Jaysh pass Hafirah pass Mecca Medina road. Al-Samhudi: Dhat Jaysh six miles from Dhu al-Hulayfah - Ibn Wahb six miles from al-Aqiq, seems meant from side Dhu al-Hulayfah, close Ibn Waddah: Seven miles from al-Aqiq, Ibn al-Qasim ten miles between, al-Tha'alibi twelve miles, said two miles between. Al-Shanqiti: Dhat al-Jaysh valley on Medina Jeddah road middle Bida' after Dhu al-Hulayfah, before bridge intersect Hejrah line road with Jeddah road, this valley strong modern bridge. I say: Scholars differed preceding determining Dhat al-Jaysh location, direction from Medina, distance between Medina, can't exit sayings saying gathers, determines Dhat al-Jaysh location, but sayings - despite difference - hardly distance determination from al-Aqiq Bida' Turban. This place - Dhat al-Jaysh - fame Prophet's expeditions, Ibn Ishaq describing Prophet's road Badr major expedition: Took road from Medina to Mecca, Nqab Medina, al-Aqiq, Dhu al-Hulayfah, Ulat al-Jaysh - Ibn Hisham - Dhat al-Jaysh - Ibn Ishaq: Passed Turban, Malal, Ghumis al-Hamam rest road. I say: From Ibn Ishaq determines Dhat al-Jaysh between Dhu al-Hulayfah Turban. From apparent hadith Aisha: We Bida' or Dhat al-Jaysh, preceded Bida' drawing: Bida' between Dhu al-Hulayfah Dhat al-Jaysh, but Ibn Ishaq passed Bida' from Dhu al-Hulayfah Dhat al-Jaysh. These three places Dhu al-Hulayfah, Bida', Dhat al-Jaysh connect some each other, closest facing Medina Dhu al-Hulayfah, behind Bida', after Bida' Dhat al-Jaysh. Atiq al-Biladi: Dhu al-Hulayfah today Abi Ali wells prosperous town nine km Medina Mecca, takes Bida' towards Mecca, Dhat al-Jaysh, Turban. Also said: Prepared journey - meaning from Medina - road Dhu al-Hulayfah south west, after 24 km ascended Ri'ah Dhat al-Jaysh, today Mufrahat Ri'ah flows large Tel'ah called al-Shalbiyah, known Dhat al-Jaysh sunrise flows al-Aqiq al-Wusta village left our road. From this Ri'ah flows Turban valley south west gathers Malal. Mufrahat cafes small lodging. I say: Ibn Ishaq determining Dhat al-Jaysh Atiq al-Biladi observation these places journey determination consistent Mufrahat current name Dhat al-Jaysh. Bida' drawing more clarification - preceded - see it.","Translation":"This story talks about Aisha's necklace loss incident, may God be pleased with her, during travel with the Prophet, peace be upon him, where the tayammum verse descended afterward."},{"Place":"Dhat al-Salasil","City":"North of Medina","Description":"Place in Judham land. Bukhari: Expedition Dhat al-Salasil, Lakhm Judham expedition, Ismail bin Abi Khalid said, Ibn Ishaq from Yazid from Urwah: Balay lands Udhrah Banu Balqayn.

Ibn Hajar: Dhat al-Salasil silent them, famous open first, plural salsalah, named some sand one on other like chain, recorded Ibn al-Athir dammah meaning salsal easy. Named Dhat al-Salasil infidels tied each other fearing flee, or water called salsal. Ibn Ishaq: Dhat al-Salasil Banu Udhrah land, Messenger sent Amr bin al-As rally Arabs al-Sham - Amr's mother Balay woman - sent rally them. When water Judham land called salsal, thus expedition named Dhat al-Salasil expedition.

Muslims charged fled, escaped fleeing scattered. Amr raided there stayed days heard no gathering no place went, sent horse owners came sheep camels slaughtered ate, no more spoils than that, no spoils divide except mentioned. Yaqut: Salasil plural salsalah: water Judham land, thus Dhat al-Salasil named. Ibn Ishaq: Water name salsal named Dhat al-Salasil. Jiran al-Awd said: In clan Milaa' al-Khimar as if mad with skin turning. Like thorns torment saliva, intoxication mixed quince. Viewer likens resembling egg morning dew from it ostrich al-Hajnaf. Bottom Dhat al-Salasil meets it from al-Alqa plant gathered. Al-Ra'i said: When ascended Dhat al-Salasil turned to it listening for sudden rough winds. Ibn Sa'd: Dhat al-Salasil beyond villages, between Medina ten days, Jumada al-Akhirah 8 migration. I say: Scholars didn't differ Dhat al-Salasil expedition - direction what Amr bin al-As companions Muslims met - location Dhat al-Salasil Judham land ten nights from Medina north.","Translation":"This story talks about Dhat Al-Salasil expedition, one of the Prophet Muhammad's expeditions, peace be upon him. Amr bin Al-As led the army to mobilize Arabs towards the Levant, sending Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah to reinforce with Muhajirun and Ansar led by Abu Bakr and Umar, may God be pleased with them. The expedition aimed to ally Bali and Quda'ah, ending chasing enemy to Judham land, defeating and dispersing them."},{"Place":"Dhat Irq","City":"Makkah Al-Mukarramah  (Miqat for Iraq people)","Description":"Hajj miqat for Iraq people. Bukhari narrated from Ibn Umar: When these two cities opened came Umar said: O Commander Faithful, Messenger Allah limited Najd people Qarn unjust our road, if intend Qarn hard us. Said: Look opposite your road, limited Dhat Irq. Ibn Hajar: Dhat Irq broken ayin silent ra' after qaf, named small mountain. Salt land grows tarfa, between Mecca two stages, distance 42 miles. Limit separating Najd Tihamah. Al-Harbi Manasik: Abdul Allah bin Muhammad bin Sinan al-Sa'di narrated: Ibrahim bin Siyar narrated: Ibn Uyaynah from father: Said Ahal Dhat Irq Najd or suspects? Said: No Najd no suspects, Ghawr people. Abdul Allah bin Amr narrated: Ali bin Muhammad bin Zamam al-Hilali heard: Abu Muhammad bin Zamam from father: Dhat Irq named after irq white mountain valley called Dhat al-Hul, Jahiliyyah few houses there, when people increased moved here, Mahdi built ihram mosque. Abu Umar al-Sana'ani others from Musa bin Dawud from Muslim bin Khalid from Ibn Jurayj from Ata from Jabir: Prophet timed Iraq people Dhat Irq. Hamad al-Jasir commented: Correct Umar's timing his caliphate, Iraq opened his caliphate. Abdul Allah bin Umar al-Balkhi narrated: Abdul Allah bin Rabah bin al-Ahwas informed: Kathir bin Yahya bin Sawadah from father: Prophet came till overlooked Thaniyah Masjid al-Najd, prayed it, overlooked Dhat Irq village called Irq Dhat, asked about it, shunned didn't enter, Prophet named Dhat Irq, marched till entered Rahat village, stopped camel, struck stick gushed spring, irrigates lowest Wadi al-Nakhl Rahat, trace camel rock. Then beside Dhat Irq spring one night towards Qiblah Rahat, al-Zubayr clan fiefs, Muhammad bin Yusuf al-Ja'fari, spring called Prophet's spring.

Raised voices ihlal till passed Dhat Irq passed without path. Ahmad bin Amr arjuzah cited al-Harbi: Then meet us Dhat Irq place gathers path people. From every Hajj deviant horizon. No ihram dissolution without shaving. Disheveled follow true religion. Greet said O Mighty preserve. Built Abi al-Fadl this creation. All narrate quench. Allah rewards every deserving.

Al-Hijri quoted Nizar al-Ta'ami Rubay'ah bin Aqil: Halaliyyah closest place settles Thaniyah Khayl or Furu' al-Dara'ib. Furu' al-Dara'ib hill top Wadi Dhat Irq. Hamad al-Jasir: Dhat Irq now known Daribah al-Hanu, from it Iraq pilgrims ihram before car road repair now passing Qarn al-Manazil al-Sayl. I say: This era name Daribah prevails Dhat Irq - as above - became known only Daribah or al-Hanu, Hajj road passing this miqat called Daribah road al-Hanu road. 1361 AH first Hajj on mounts, took Ashirah road going Mecca, ihram Qarn al-Manazil al-Sayl, return Hajj Najd took Dhat Irq road, known only Daribah or al-Hanu name.","Translation":"This story talks about Iraq's people's Hajj miqat, \"Dhat Irq.\" The hadith narrates determining this miqat based on Caliph Umar bin Al-Khattab's directives, may God be pleased with him, named after a small mountain there.

Bukhari narrated from Abdullah bin Umar: Man stood mosque said: O Messenger Allah where order us ihlal? Said: Medina people ihlal from Dhu al-Hulayfah, Sham people Juhfah, Najd people Qarn. Ibn Umar said: Claim Messenger Allah said: Yemen people Yalamlam.

When arrived ordered people حل till Tarwiyah day ihlal Hajj. Ibn Hajar: Dhu al-Hulayfah silent fa' diminished - known place - between Mecca 200 miles less two, Ibn Hazm said, others: Ten stages between.

When returning descended valley bottom, when emerged valley bottom camped Bat'ha' valley eastern edge, camped till morning pray Fajr. Flood entered Bat'ha' buried place Prophet camped. Larger mosque ihram mosque al-Shajarah, other left mosque al-Mu'arras. I say: Yaqut al-Bakri said Dhu al-Hulayfah water between Banu Jusham bin Bakr bin Hawazin Banu Khafajah Aqiliyyin, this saying not apply this place - Dhu al-Hulayfah Medina people's miqat - but confusion another place.

Ihram mosque caliphs cared building renewal from Umar bin Abd al-Aziz till Saudi Kingdom built modern beautiful, carpeted fine carpets, chandeliers lighting, provided necessary facilities: bathrooms paved roads, Allah reward good.

House idols Daws Khuza'ah Bajilah whoever their lands Arabs Tabalah, idol them Jarir bin Abdullah al-Bajli burned sent Prophet.

Yemeni Ka'bah Abraha bin al-Sabah al-Himyari built. House remained, idol called al-Khalsah demolished. Said: Dhu al-Khalsah called Yemeni Ka'bah, Sacred House Sham Ka'bah. Abu al-Qasim al-Zamakhshari: Saying who claimed Dhu al-Khalsah house idol view; because Dhu not added except genus names. Ibn Habib Muhabbar: Dhu al-Khalsah house worshipped Bajilah Khuza'ah al-Harith bin Ka'b Jurhum Zayd Ghauth bin Mur bin Ud Banu Hilal bin Amir, custodians between Mecca Yemen al-Ablat eight stages Mecca, today plaster house informed.

Qadi Ayad al-Maghribi: Dhu al-Khalsah movement sometimes dammah first more, some narrated silent lam, Ibn Durayd. House idol Daws homes, name idol not building name. I say: What Yaqut contained different sayings scholars group, most confusion between Dhu al-Khalsah Daws lands Dhu al-Khalsah Khuza'ah, sayings agree Dhu al-Khalsah idol Khuza'ah lands Tabalah, differed describing determining location Tabalah. Some said: Lower Mecca set Amr bin Luhay, some Yemeni Ka'bah Abraha bin al-Sabah al-Himyari built, one said describing: Dhu al-Khalsah house idol in, one: Place today mosque comprehensive village al-Ablat Khuza'ah land, say: This saying strange far correct. Closest correct what Abu al-Mundhir said: Among Arabs idols Dhu al-Khalsah white quartz carved like crown shape, Tabalah between Mecca Yemen seven nights Mecca. Rest what said, noticed Abu al-Qasim al-Zamakhshari saying who claimed Dhu al-Khalsah house idol in view; because Dhu added only genus names. I say: Explicit Abi Hurayrah hadith Bukhari Sahih indication Daws lands idol worship attribute them, hadith text: Dhu al-Khalsah Daws taghut worshipped Jahiliyyah, Jarir bin Abdullah al-Bajli hadith proof Khuza'ah idol named Dhu al-Khalsah their lands Tabalah worship, Prophet sent Jarir bin Abdullah demolish fight worshippers Khuza'ah. Ibn Hajar commented Jarir hadith confusion some historians between two idols make one - preceded -. Daws tribe Arab still settled ancient homes unchanged west Sarawat facing Tihamah, under Bahah emirate. Khuza'ah tribe Arab ancient homes still residing Tabalah eastern Sarawat slopes facing Najd, under Asir emirate via Bishah governorate. I say: Visited Tabalah Wednesday 4 Dhu al-Qa'dah Thursday after 1401 AH, visited idol Dhu al-Khalsah site viewed remains traces, visited ancient Tabalah town hill sought help knowledgeable Tabalah residents recognize landmarks ancient religious urban remains. After search viewing appeared idol Dhu al-Khalsah black mountain extended south north, southern end overlooks northern Tabalah valley bank, extends north till northern end mountains overlooking Wadi Surum lower, Tabalah valleys northern tributaries, stones black ancient igneous rocks, ascent top difficult except paved roads reach idol. Idol place summit overlooking Tabalah valley bottom relatively high, around idol site large rocks, west side rooms lined north south, built mountain rocks themselves unroofed, western sides open no ancient foundations traces close, east side rooms fewer western. Summit slight inscriptions, rock Sabaean ancient writing, white broken rocks perhaps remains white rock represented idol. Road ascend idol east, paved eased, opposite east vast plain Tabalah valley bank, seen ancient dwellings temples traces. Around idol two facing standing stones piles, one right one left. Idol site distance ancient Tabalah town ten km approx. Told knowledgeable elders Tabalah: Found two standing piles idol site seen distance. Some landmarks buildings paved roads leading idol religious bodies recent years changed much demolition breaking. Stone large inscription, some sheikhs came men overturned face, stone unknown among many stones. Time visit one piles removed entirely no trace left, other remained small part. Eased road ascend idol site demolished no repair remains. Worth mentioning people area know mountain idol (Irq al-Taghut), some call (Irq al-Shaytan), known this era. I say: With years passage time revisited Dhu al-Khalsah idol Tabalah, revived visit among residents area till demolished Saudi state first era Imam Abd al-Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud, Ibn Bishr referred book introduction, imams Saudi state demolished domes polytheistic places, built mosques prayers lessons remembrances, broke idol Dhu al-Khalsah Tabalah, after buttocks women shaken it. Events 1230 AH: Muhammad Ali armies departed Turabah marched Bishah, descended Aklab obeyed, marched Tabalah, town Muslims demolished Dhat al-Khalsah Abd al-Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud time, idol Prophet sent Jarir bin Abdullah al-Bajli demolished, when time lengthened rebuilt worshipped. This reason - reviving this idol - religious bodies concerned recent years obliterating landmarks demolishing roads leading place fearing revival time again - preceded. White rock idol erected, said after removal transferred one Tabalah mosques. Yaqut: (Dhu al-Khalsah today threshold Tabalah mosque door) During visit research investigate landmarks history, visited Dhu al-Khalsah place, visited ancient mosque comprehensive ancient town hill valley, town become deserted empty inhabitants, mosque likewise, ruin creeping residences. Toured town visited mosque, found indicated rock not erected mosque door threshold usual way, hidden ground inside mosque beside inner threshold, town people know nothing connect idol, after village deserted flood rushes mosque door force removed threshold, began erode mosque entrance exit large opening opposite wall descends valley, after successive erosion revealed edges this rock, then dug extracted, now exists that mosque. White rock length meter, width near, thickness exceeds twenty centimeters, polished sides, no writing trace or inscription, color differs this land mountains, indicates transferred this town another place - Tabalah mountains all black, this rock white. This idol Dhu al-Khalsah Khuza'ah lands Tabalah, Prophet sent Khalid bin al-Walid no Jarir bin Abdullah al-Bajli. Ibn Hajar explaining Abi Hurayrah hadith meaning this narrated al-Hakim from Abdullah bin Umar: Not Hour till push shoulders Banu Amir women Dhu al-Khalsah. Ibn Hajar didn't specify which idol intended, Hamad al-Jasir comments: Though citing context explaining Abi Hurayrah hadith understood intended Daws idol, but I see Dhu al-Khalsah mentioned Ibn Umar trace Khuza'ah idol, Banu Amir worshippers Banu Hilal them custodians one sayings. I say: What Hamad al-Jasir said comment closer correct. Dhu al-Khalsah: Like previous idol Daws tribe their lands. Bukhari Sahih narrated from Abi Hurayrah: Messenger Allah said not Hour till buttocks Daws women shake around Dhu al-Khalsah, Dhu al-Khalsah Daws taghut worshipped Jahiliyyah. Ibn Hajar: Saying around Dhu al-Khalsah: Ma'mar narration from al-Zuhri Muslim: around Dhu al-Khalsah. Saying: Dhu al-Khalsah Daws taghut: idol, idol Daws worshipped, Ma'mar added: Tabalah, Tabalah village between Taif Yemen between six days, proverb: Easier than Tabalah Hajjaj. Because first governed, when neared asked with about, said: Behind that hill. Returned said: No good town hill hides. Matali' owner speech requires two places: or intended hadith other Tabalah Hajjaj. Hamad al-Jasir visited Dhu al-Khalsah site Daws lands, visit Wednesday 23 Safar 1390 AH, journey start Mandiq - Bahah emirate seat said: After distance reached 14 miles Mandiq Thuruk, after about two miles travel Thuruk land reached largest village, called (Rams). Crossed Rams village foot heading north west, after five minutes walk descended valley farms wells called (Sha'b Dhi al-Khalsah) this sha'b descends Thuruk branch, also called Wadi Thuruk, then headed west exited sha'b ... After crossing valley about 300 meters ascended rocky hill elevated, between depressions, east Sha'b Dhi al-Khalsah, west Tihamah, north south depressions flow Sha'b Dhi al-Khalsah. Top this rocky hill jabayl stood Dhu al-Khalsah idol many contemporary researchers see. Didn't witness top hill except rocks some broken, some remain used building, rectangular shape, rock exceeds cubit length half cubit width, larger. Didn't distinguish building landmarks except two large rocks between nearly cubit, one us from village said: This door, connects rectangular place length approaches eight cubits, width three, large rocks appear sides some broken, said Dhu al-Khalsah house, remaining broken rocks traces indicate around place surrounded building, include rocky hill area 60x60 meters approx length west east 58 steps square approx, as if placed fence rectangular building mentioned earlier. This hill overlooks Tihamah, vast land called al-Jarda' Banu Ali Manhab Daws lands, seen mountains Tihamah valleys, seen Ibrahim mountain Banu Malik lands. Tihamah borders this place western side, east Wadi known (Sha'b Dhi al-Khalsah) separates (al-Habshah) broken ha' open ba' shin dotted open, Banu Manhab Daws village, their lands include Sarawat part adjacent Tihamah (al-Jarda'). No doubt this Dhu al-Khalsah site idol Daws tribe worshipped before Islam advent, is it one Prophet sent Jarir bin Abdullah al-Bajli demolish burned? Don't see, but see name Dhu al-Khalsah applies multiple idols most famous Dhu al-Khalsah Jarir burned Tabalah Khuza'ah lands, this Dhu al-Khalsah Daws lands. Demolished when Daws idols demolished after Islam before Jarir burning Dhu al-Khalsah Tabalah. Difference between Daws Khuza'ah idols Hafiz Ibn Hajar said book (Fath al-Bari Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari). Hamad al-Jasir spoke two Dhu al-Khalsah idols comprehensive talk, our place not accommodate mention came, concluded saying: No need prolongation, preceding suffices prove two multiple idols, each called Dhu al-Khalsah, one Daws, second Khuza'ah others Arabs, Jarir demolished. Rushdi Saleh Malhas said: When Majesty King Abd al-Aziz al-Faisal Al Saud king Saudi Arabia conquered Hijaz 1343 AH, appointed Abd al-Aziz bin Ibrahim emir Taif district, delegated lead campaign sent conquer tribes inhabiting Sarawat Hijaz. After campaign subdued Zahran tribes dwelling known valley exited Daws mountains Rabi' al-Thani 1344 AH, Daskarah (Thuruk) Dhu al-Khalsah building walls still standing, beside Ubla' tree, campaign burned tree, demolished house, threw ruins valley, trace effaced trace cut. One accompanied campaign: Dhu al-Khalsah building huge less 40 persons can't move one stone, solidity indicates skill proficiency building. One Zahran sheikhs: Khalsah building complete, Imam Saud Great conquered Asir first quarter 13th century demolished part, walls remained till 1344 AH mentioned. I say: Preceding sufficient clarification Dhu al-Khalsah name idol Daws lands, idol Khuza'ah lands Tabalah, statement role Saudi state played demolishing remains these two idols places removal.","Translation":"The text summary covers idols' history in the Arabian Peninsula, telling idols worshiped by Arab tribes in Jahiliyyah.

Talks about important events like smashing idols in Taif by Jarir bin Abdullah Al-Bajali by the noble Messenger's order. Indicates some people still worship these idols today. Concludes demolishing remaining idols in other Arabian Peninsula areas, mentioning Saudi state's efforts destroying what's left to preserve monotheism and faith in one God."},{"Place":"Dhu Tuwa","City":"Makkah Al-Mukarramah","Description":"Valley in Mecca. Bukhari narrated from Abdullah bin Umar: Prophet descended Dhu Tuwa stayed till morning prayed Fajr when came Mecca. Ibn Hajar: Dhu Tuwa dammah ta' majority asserted, Jawhari asserted, Hamawi Mustamli narration (Dhu al-Tuwa) addition alif lam Asili conditioned broken, Ayad others narrated open also. Al-Harbi describing road Tan'im sacred mosque: Malik bin Dinar from al-Qasim from Aisha: Prophet made her Umrah Tan'im, then Aisha mosque after two miles Mecca four miles, Fakh after Aisha mosque two miles, Uqbah al-Madaniyyin after Fakh left, Tuwa road opposite, then Dhu Tuwa, from sacred mosque half mile. Narrated from Asma': Year conquest Messenger descended Dhu Tuwa. Describing road Mecca Jeddah: If want Jeddah exit Mecca descend Dhu Tuwa, take left then take orchards roofed till reach stage, name Qarin al-Tha'lab, village wells, exit Hudah twenty miles. Hamad al-Jasir commented these places: Dhu Tuwa now inside Mecca houses, building exceeded distances, location street northern end formerly Sheikh Abdullah bin Sulayman Finance Minister residence extending south till meets road coming Ri' al-Kahl towards al-Hujun. Said: Dhu Tuwa still known Jarwal neighborhood inside Mecca now. Commented Hudah: Open ha' now large town 35 km approx Mecca. Al-Azraqi: Bakkah Ka'bah blessed mosque people, Mecca Dhu Tuwa, valley Mecca Allah mentioned Fath surah. Narrated from Abdullah bin al-Zubayr: Nation Banu Israel approached Mecca, when reached Dhu Tuwa removed sandals revering sanctuary. Narrated from Abdullah bin Umar: Messenger descended Dhu Tuwa stayed prayed Fajr when came Mecca. Al-Azraqi: Dhu Tuwa bottom: Between descent cemetery pass Ma'lah furthest pass called al-Khadra' descend migrants graves below Fakh. Commentator: Wadi Dhu Tuwa between Hajun cemetery Ma'lah Ri' al-Kahl called al-Khadra' pass. Was Wadi Tuwa called (Wadi Dabi') today known Bir al-Hindi. Al-Fakihi: Bir Umm al-Nu'man Dhu Tuwa: People drank during fitnah Ismail bin Yusuf al-Talibi time.

Al-Fakihi: Thaniyah Kuda: Dammah kaf, descend it Dhu Tuwa, entered Qays bin Sa'd bin Ubada conquest day, exited Messenger to Medina.

Al-Fakihi narrated from Nafi': Ibn Umar when came Mecca descended Dhu Tuwa, when morning bathed he companions ordered, entered Mecca touched stone circumambulated House. Dhu Tuwa poet says: If come highest Dhu Tuwa its valley stop call it you Allah's peace O hill mistress. Say them wish caravans passed to Sal' people returned you. Another poet mentions: Water Wasit curved its arak summer highest Dhu Tuwa its square. Al-Fakihi: Dhu Tuwa bottom: Between descent cemetery pass Ma'lah furthest called al-Khadra'. Commentator: Called today al-Atibiyyah al-Khadra' pass Ri' al-Kahl. Yaqut: Tuwa open shortened, tuwa hunger, Tuwa thing folded. From it Adi bin Zayd: Justice if blame not place on me tuwa your deviation repeated. You say tuwa your deviation me time after time as if fold your deviation me time after time. Saying exalted: {in the sacred valley of Tuwa} Tuwa twice meaning blessed sanctified. Hasan bin Abi al-Hasan: Folded blessing sanctification twice so only spent: place Sham near Tur. Yaqut: Foreign name mentioned Quran valley, allowed four ways Tuwa dammah without tanwin with tanwin, who tanwin name valley on fa'l like hitam jarad who not tanwin left spending two directions one diverted Taw becomes like Umar diverted Amir not spent like Umar not spent. Other direction name spot as exalted: {in the blessed spot from the tree}, read dammah kasrah like ma'i tali not tanwin Tuwa kasrah like ma' Tali tanwin who not tanwin made name exaggeration.

Al-Bukhari narrated on the authority of Jabir bin Abdullah, may God be pleased with him, that the Prophet, peace be upon him, prayed the fear prayer with his companions in the seventh expedition, the Battle of Dhat al-Riqa', and Ibn Abbas said the Prophet, peace be upon him, prayed the fear prayer at Dhu Qard. From Yazid bin Salama: I raided with the Prophet, peace be upon him, on the day of Qard. Ibn Hajar said: Dhu Qard with fathah on qaf and ra', a place about a day's distance from the city toward the lands of Ghatafan. Al-Waqidi in the account of the Battle of al-Ghaba: when the Muslims caught up with the enemy, Muhriz bin Nadla was killed from them, and Abu Qatada went out and killed Mas'ada, and Awthar and Amr bin Awthar were killed by Ukasha bin Mihsan, and Habib bin Uyayna was on his horse, he and Khariqa bin Malik bin Hudhayfa bin Badr were killed by al-Miqdad bin Amr. They said: the people caught up at Dhu Qard, and the Prophet led them in the fear prayer... He said: the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, stayed at Dhu Qard for a day and a night awaiting news. Yaqut said: Qard with tahrik, improvised, and it was said: al-Qard is poor wool, and Abu Muhammad al-Aswad narrated it as Qard with two dammahs also. Thus say the imams of knowledge: Dhu Qard is a water two nights from the city between it and Khaybar, and the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, reached it when he went out in pursuit of Uyayna when he raided his camels. Aban bin Uthman, the owner of al-Maghazi, said: Dhu Qard is a water for Talha bin Ubayd Allah who bought it and endowed it for passersby. Qadi Iyad said: in the hadith of Qubaysa in the Sahih, at Dhu Qard was the grazing camels of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, that Ghatafan raided, and this is a mistake, it was at al-Ghaba near the city. He said: Dhu Qard is where the Muslims reached at the end of the day and stayed there overnight and departed from it, so the expedition was named after it, as clarified in the hadith of Salama bin al-Akwa' in the Sira, and some of Muslim's shaykhs said at the end of Qutayba's hadith: he caught up with them at Dhu Qard, indicating that because they did not take the grazing and stay in their place until the pursuit caught up. The Qadi said: between Dhu Qard and the city about a day, and Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi said: the Battle of al-Ghaba is the Battle of Dhu Qard in year six, mentioned in al-Ghaba. Hassan bin Thabit said: God took them with a belt and the might of the Merciful with the barriers, they were in a house of luxury then exchanged for days of Dhu Qard and faces of slaves. Al-Imrani said: the expedition of Dhu Qard for the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. Ibn Ishaq in the account of the expedition of Dhu Qard: the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, marched until he descended at the mountain of Dhu Qard and the people caught up with him, so the Messenger of God descended there and stayed a day and a night. I say: there occurred in what preceded disagreement among scholars in describing Dhu Qard, some said place, some water, some mountain, and Ibn Hisham clarified in his hadith about the expedition of Dhu Qard that Dhu Qard is a mountain, and to reconcile these opinions it can be said: Dhu Qard is the name for the mountain and a water in it, as they differed in determining the distance between it and the city, and from the Sira of the Prophet's expedition, peace be upon him, this place is not more than a good day's march for the raiders from the city. Atik al-Biladi determined the distance between Qard and the city saying: Qard mountain at the top of Wadi al-Naqmi northeast of the city about (35) km. I say: this determination agrees with some saying a day's distance from the city. I say: since this place is still known by its name, I suffice with what preceded from the historians' sayings, and in the drawing of al-Ghaba additional clarification, so look at it.","Translation":"This story talks about a mountain called \"Dhu Qard,\" about 35 kilometers northeast of Medina. In Dhat Al-Riqa' and Al-Ghabah expeditions, the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, prayed Salat Al-Khawf there and stayed a day and night, several historical events occurred. Narrations differ on describing Dhu Qard and place between site, water, and mountain, known today as \"Al-Qarad\"."},{"Place":"Dhu al-Majaz","City":"Makkah Al-Mukarramah","Description":"Mim open, jim dotted open, then alif, ending with dotted zay: a place near Arafat. Al-Bukhari narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, Dhu al-Majaz and Ukaz were markets of people in Jahiliyyah, when Islam came they disliked that until {There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your Lord} [Al-Baqarah: 198] was revealed, in Hajj seasons. Ibn Hajar said: Dhu al-Majaz with fathah on mim and light jim and ending with zay, in the word opposite to reality. Al-Bakri said: Dhu al-Majaz was a market of the Arabs, to the right of the standing at Arafat near Kabkab, and it is an abandoned market. Yaqut said: al-Majaz with fathah, ending with zay, it is said jazt the road jowzan and majazan and jawazan, and al-Majaz the place and similarly al-Majaza. Dhu al-Majaz: market place at Arafat, on the side of Kabkab to the right of the imam, a farsakh from Arafat: it stood in Jahiliyyah for eight days. Al-Asma'i said: Dhu al-Majaz a water from the base of Kabkab, for Hudhayl and behind Arafat, and Hassan bin Thabit addressing Abu Sufyan regarding Abu Azihar and al-Walid bin al-Mughira al-Makhzumi killed him, and Abu Sufyan was his son-in-law wanting to spare blood and paid his blood money without demanding it, so he said: Tomorrow the people of Duja Dhu al-Majaz both, and Ibn Harb came with al-Mughmis what he brings, and did not prevent the weak caravan its protector, nor prevented Makhzah and her father Hind. You clothed Hashim bin al-Walid his clothes, so worn and worn like it new after. Al-Mutawakkil al-Laythi said: For the beauties at Dhu al-Majaz traces in the belly of Makkah their covenant old, do not forbid a character and do like it, shame on you if you do great. Ibn al-Athir said: Ukaz, Dhu al-Majaz and Majanna were markets where Arabs gathered every year, when the season came they secure each other until their days end, Majanna at Dhahran, Ukaz between Nakhla and Taif, al-Majaz on the left side when standing at the standing. In al-Taj: Dhu al-Majaz: place: Abu Dhuaib said: And departed with it from Dhu al-Majaz in the evening, hastening the first racers to the rope. Al-Jawhari said: place at Mina was a market in Jahiliyyah, and al-Harith bin Hilliza said: And remember the covenant of Dhu al-Majaz and what preceded in it the covenants and guarantors. Others said: Dhu al-Majaz a market for them a farsakh from Arafat toward Kabkab, named because the Hajj's permission was in it, and Lughda said: Dhu al-Majaz: water from the base of Kabkab for Hudhayl, and Abu Abdullah al-Waqidi said: Ukaz between Nakhla and Taif, Dhu al-Majaz behind Arafat, Majanna at Marr al-Dhahran, these are markets of Quraysh and Arabs. Hamd al-Jasir said: Dhu al-Majaz: now called al-Majaz - and it is a great valley surrounding Kabkab from its west then passing by Arafat, with waters and farms on rain, its people Hudhayl. Atik al-Biladi said: al-Majaz: sha'b pouring from mount Kabkab from its western side heading west until it pours into Wadi Arna, at the meeting with Wadi Hanin, eight kilometers from the sign of Najd road east, and the length of this sha'b not more than ten kilometers. This is the site of the famous Dhu al-Majaz market, and al-Majaz north of Arafat about half the distance between it and al-Shara'i'. Muhammad bin Bulayhid said: Dhu al-Majaz located in Wadi al-Mughmis, when you cross Wadi al-Shara'i known and you intend Makkah you come to Wadi al-Mughmis on the road to your left, when you align with Kabkab it is there, with old traces still standing to this era, and it is a market of Jahiliyyah famous. I say: this what historians mentioned in determining Dhu al-Majaz market and defining its location, all agree it in the side of Kabkab and Kabkab still known by its name, likewise Dhu al-Majaz, and since this place still by its name and the places determined by: Kabkab, Arafat, al-Mughmis, still known by their names famous so I suffice with this amount of talk about the place of Dhu al-Majaz market, except that this market its commercial activity ceased and merchants cut off from it since the appearance of Islam.","Translation":"This story talks about \"Dhu Al-Majaz,\" a place near Arafat, a market of Arabs in Jahiliyyah. Markets held there eight days, some Quranic verses descended permitting trade in Hajj season. Commercial market activity ceased since Islam's emergence."},{"Place":"Al-Rabdha","City":"Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah","Description":"Ra' open silent ba' unified open and dhal dotted open ending with ha': village between al-Salila and Mawaan on the old Iraqi Hajj road, affiliated with the city. Al-Bukhari narrated on the authority of Sulayman bin Harb: narrated Shu'ba from Wasil from al-Ma'rur said met Abu Dharr at al-Rabdha and on him a garment and on his slave a garment so asked him about that he said I abused a man and reproached him with his mother so the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to me O Abu Dharr did you reproach him with his mother indeed you are a man with Jahiliyyah in you your brothers your servants God placed them under your hands so whoever's brother under his hand let him feed him from what he eats and clothe him from what he wears and not burden them what overcomes them if burdened help them. Ibn Hajar said al-Rabdha with fathah on ra' and ba' and dhal: place in the desert between it and the city three stages. Al-Harbi from Abu Qays al-Kalabi: named al-Rabdha after Rabdha a red mountain red rock, a mile from al-Rabdha toward the west tall red, its name Rabdh. He said in determining the distance between al-Rabdha and Mawaan and between it and al-Salila: from Mughitha al-Mawaan to al-Rabdha twenty miles, from al-Rabdha to al-Salila twenty-three and half miles, with palace and mosque, and mosque for Abu Dharr companion of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. Amir al-Mu'minin Uthman bin Affan, may God be pleased with him, settled him in al-Rabdha, because Abu Dharr chose it. Narrated on the authority of Umm Dharr: when death came to Abu Dharr he said to me: go look perhaps caravans pass inform them, she said: I would go out every day from al-Rabdha climb a mountain until a caravan passed by me, I waved to them with my garment, they came I said: O these a Muslim man dying attend him, they said: who is he? I said: Abu Dharr, they said: companion of the Messenger of God? I said: yes, they ransomed him with their fathers and mothers, and mentioned a long hadith, he said: we handled him and buried him there, in a group all Yemeni, among them Hujr bin al-Adbar and Malik bin al-Ashtar. Al-Rabdha for people from descendants of al-Zubayr bin al-Awwam, for Fazara with two ponds left, one round with filter, the other from the house less than a mile square. With many wells, best is well known as Abu Dharr, and Buthr known as Bani al-Mundhir, and two wells known as al-Mahdi between them basin, and well known as Masjid well it is Abu Dharr's well, and well known as Abu al-Sa'b thick water, and well known as Quta, and small well known as Abd al-Rahman well, and well in the east lined with stones known as Isa bin Musa, and well known as Ibn Mahir a mile and half from al-Rabdha. Etc. Al-Hijri said: al-Rabdha with fathah first and second and dhal dotted it Umar, may God be pleased with him, made it a reserve for charity camels, his reserve was a post in a post, then the governors added multiples to the reserve, then the reserves were permitted in al-Mahdi's days, no one reserved after that. Then continued his talk about boundaries of al-Rabdha reserve and its signs and waters entered in it comprehensive talk our place does not allow mentioning. Etc. Lughda said: lands of Muharib between al-Khayalat to Arik to side of al-Dahna to jawf al-Rabdha, al-Khayalat mountains of al-Naqra between it and sunrises, beside Tamiya, then for them between al-Rabdha to Faran, opposite al-Salila, and from their mountains Mawaan black huge mountain, al-Muharibi said: if Mawaan appears our longing lengthened to the corner from Mawaan if apparent, if burdened me leading Mawaan I led leading the camel or cut my heart. Beside it well called Mawaan well, poet says: drank from Mawaan bitter water and from hump like it or evil. Sinam this mountain near al-Rabdha. Yaqut said: al-Rabdha with fathah first and second, dhal dotted open also: from villages of the city on three days, near Dhat Irq, on Hijaz road if departed from Fid intending Makkah, at this place grave of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, may God be pleased with him, his name Jundab bin Junada, went out to it angry with Uthman bin Affan, may God be pleased with him, stayed until died year 32 AH. Read in history of Abu Muhammad Ubayd Allah bin Abd al-Majid bin Siran al-Ahwazi said: in year 319 AH al-Rabdha ruined by connection of wars between its people and people of Dariya, then people of Dariya sought protection from Qarmatians who aided them against them so people of al-Rabdha migrated ruined, was best station on Makkah road. Al-Asma'i mentioning Najd: al-Sharf liver of Najd, in al-Sharf al-Rabdha, the right reserve. In Nasr's book: al-Rabdha of Hajj stations between al-Salila and al-Amiq. Al-Rabdha of Hajj stations between and attributed to al-Rabdha people among them Abu Abd al-Aziz Musa bin Ubayda bin Nashit al-Rabdhi, and his brothers Muhammad and Abdullah, Abdullah narrated from Jabir from Uqba bin Amir narrated from him his brother Musa killed by Khawarij year 130 AH and others, then mentioned names of number of scholars and hadith narrators attributed to town of al-Rabdha. Etc. Al-Bakri said: at al-Rabdha died Abu Dharr when exiled from the city, not with him except his wife and his slave, as the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, informed him in expedition of Tabuk, that Abu Dharr when his camel delayed took his baggage on his back then walked following trace of the Messenger of God, a lookout from Muslims looked said O Messenger of God this man walking on the road, the Messenger of God said: be Abu Dharr, when the people looked said: O Messenger of God it is by God Abu Dharr, he said: may God have mercy on Abu Dharr, walks alone, dies alone, resurrected alone. I say: from what Yaqut and others mentioned it becomes clear to us that al-Rabdha located in al-Sharf in upper Najd, was prosperous town, best of Hajj stations on Makkah road from Iraq, ruined and empty of its people due to wars between its people and people of Dariya. As for how to reconcile description of al-Rabdha - at time of death of Abu Dharr may God be pleased with him - news of his death implies he died and none in it except him his wife and slave, news implies he died year 32 AH and it at that time was not if was grazing of charity camels, Umar bin al-Khattab reserved it for them, and reserved after him the caliphs, seems no urbanization grew in it except after Iraqi Hajj road drawn on it, made station of Hajj stations, wells dug in it and ponds built, built beside ponds and wells in Hajj stations palaces, inhabited by guardians of these wells and ponds, and who maintain them, commercial works arose in these stations with Hajj and villages built, al-Rabdha had the greater share of urbanization among Hajj stations, until historians said: it of best Hajj stations. I say: during my visit to this village - we were three Hamd al-Jasir, Muhammad al-Ubudi, and I third - confirmed to us that this place we visiting is town of al-Rabdha, after seeing it and applying what historians mentioned about its description and description of surrounding landmarks. This town - I mean al-Rabdha - located on bank of valley coming from east, heading west crowded with rumth trees and much talh and salam, has tributary coming from east meets it at the village, from this tributary the large round pond fills. The village on eastern bank of the valley, clear landmarks along the valley, ruined wells, one well lined with stones inhabited, in its northern and western side large cemetery on eastern bank of the valley, other graves in another place, between the inhabited well and inhabited pond, beside it wide well and old ruined houses, in its northeastern north of inhabited well traces of old village, nothing left but large hill of dirt and stones, and debris of colored pottery vessels and glass, affected by antiquity factors in coloring and shaping, beside inhabited well from west large mosque evident landmarks, overlooking valley from east, round inhabited pond, with square filter beside its west, this pond still inhabited, good condition, its diameter length 220 feet. Al-Hamdani drew: stations of Hajj road from Makkah to Iraq said: who took the main road to mine of al-Naqra, from Makkah to al-Bustan twenty-nine miles, from it to Dhat Irq twenty-four miles, from it to al-Ghamra twenty miles, from it to Harat Bani Salim twenty-six miles, from it to al-Amiq twenty-two miles, from it to al-Salila thirteen miles, from it to al-Rabdha twenty-three miles, from it to al-Mawaan twenty-six miles from it to mine of al-Naqra twenty-three miles, it meeting of two roads, this estimation of Iraq road as some Iraqi scholars did. Etc. As for road from al-Rabdha to the city, al-Harbi clarified saying: deviate from al-Rabdha to Abraq al-Azzaf twenty miles, from Abraq al-Azzaf to al-Sitar twenty-five, at Dhi al-Qassa many waters from Dhi al-Qassa to the city thirty miles exit on well of al-Sa'ib between it and the city five miles, al-Rashid took this road it hundred miles and two between al-Rabdha and the city, some determined it. Al-Harbi mentioned in (book of rituals) drawing for Iraqi Hajj road arranged from Baghdad to Makkah, passing al-Rabdha, mentioned distance between each station and next this from Hajj stations, presented poem in drawing road from Iraq to Makkah for ascending, mention what concerns determining location of al-Rabdha from it, starting from Mughitha al-Mawaan, the poet said: then to Mughitha al-Mawaan ahead, linked them with al-Arsan and stood with al-Asha'ar two drivers on description from who known with kindness and from clothed them glory and al-Dan lived and no like them two then we headed intending al-Rabdha and station in isolated village by road gainer who took it not regret ever with who penetrated it and between us daughter of kings al-Badhda for who passed from kings the taker then we moved to al-Salila stage its waters few fail its guest the dweller so aided the one with beautiful hand with spending moneys for her plentiful extracted water with every trick then we headed intending al-Amiq home of truth never ceased frequented with well water good its drawn and the camels hurry in darkness groups and their riders connect al-Arqa and light in the dome clears the horizon. I say: from what preceded of scholars' sayings in determining location of al-Rabdha and describing its road and landmarks, confirms that this place we visited and described is village of al-Rabdha, and in it reply to who says al-Rabdha is village of al-Hanakiya. This summary what I mentioned about al-Rabdha in my book (dictionary of upper Najd), exhausted talk about it from all aspects expanded, likewise news of Abu Dharr residing in it and his death may God be pleased with him.","Translation":"This story talks about Al-Rabdhah town, between Al-Salilah and Mawan on old Iraqi Hajj road. Abu Dharr Al-Ghifari lived in Al-Rabdhah and died there, a prosperous town best Hajj stations on Mecca road from Iraq."},{"Place":"Al-Raji'","City":"Between Makkah and Usfan","Description":"Ra' silent jim dotted then ya' doubled silent ending with silent 'ayn: water for Hudhayl between Makkah and Usfan. Al-Bukhari said: chapter expedition of al-Raji', and Ra'l and Dhakwan, and hadith Adl and al-Qara and Asim bin Thabit and Khubayb and his companions, and Ra'l and Dhakwan. Narrated on the authority of Abu Hurayra, may God be pleased with him: the Prophet, peace be upon him, sent a spy detachment and appointed Asim bin Thabit over them, he grandfather of Asim bin Umar bin al-Khattab so they went until between Usfan and Makkah mentioned to tribe from Hudhayl called Bani Lihyan so followed them with nearly hundred archers traced their tracks until came to station they descended found in it dates provision from the city said: this Yathrib dates followed their tracks until caught them, when Asim and his companions reached they sought refuge in Fadfd came the people surrounded them said: you have covenant and pact if descend to us not kill any man from you, Asim said: as for me not descend in protection of kafir O God inform about us your prophet fought them until killed Asim in seven men with arrows, remained Khubayb and Zayd and another man gave them covenant and pact when gave them descended to them when controlled them untied strings of their bows tied them with them the third man with them said: this first betrayal refused to accompany them dragged him and dealt with him to accompany them not do killed him, went with Khubayb and Zayd until sold them in Makkah bought Bani al-Harith bin Amir bin Nawfal Khubayb and Khubayb who killed al-Harith on Badr day stayed with them prisoner until agreed on killing him... prayed two rak'ahs first who established two rak'ahs at killing he, then said: O God count them number then said: not care when killed Muslim on which side for God my fall and that in cause of God if wishes blesses on joints of dismembered body then Uqba bin al-Harith stood to him killed him and in narration for al-Bukhari from Abu Hurayra: sent the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, ten spies appointed over them Asim bin Thabit al-Ansari grandfather of Asim bin Umar bin al-Khattab until at al-Hada between Usfan and Makkah mentioned to tribe from Hudhayl called: Bani Lihyan mobilized for them. Ibn Hajar said: al-Raji' with fathah on ra' and kasrah on jim, it originally dung, named for its transformation, meant here name of place from lands of Hudhayl the incident near it named after it. Al-Waqidi: in Safar on head of thirty-six months, sent the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, companions of al-Raji' spies to Makkah to inform him news of Quraysh took on Najdiyya until at al-Raji' intercepted by Bani Lihyan. In narration: went until at water for Hudhayl called al-Raji' near al-Hada the men went out and called for help on them their companions, mentioned the news completely. Yaqut said: Raji' on fa'il, and Raji' of thing its inferior, and al-Raji' dung, and al-Raji' of animals what returned from travel it weary, and every thing returns for meaning returned. Al-Raji': place where Adl and al-Qara betrayed the seven men sent by the Messenger of God, peace be upon him... Mentioned by Abu Dhuaib: Saw and my family in Wadi al-Raji' from land of Qayla lightning pleasant. Ibn Ishaq and al-Waqidi said: al-Raji' water for Hudhayl near al-Hada between Makkah and Taif. Hassan bin Thabit said: God prayed on those who followed day al-Raji' honored and rewarded head of detachment Marthad and their leader and Ibn al-Bukayr before them and Khubayb and Ibn Tariq and Ibn Dathna from them met then his death written and al-Asim killed at their Raji' earning honors he earner prevented the chain from reaching his back until fights he brave. Al-Bakri said: al-Raji' with fathah first and 'ayn silent at end water for Hudhayl, for Bani Lihyan from them, between Makkah and Usfan in Hijaz region, from head of al-Hada said Ibn Ishaq and others, Abu Dhuaib said: Became from Umm Amr belly Marr so Ajza' al-Raji' then Dhu Sadr so Amlah and at al-Raji' Bani Lihyan from Hudhayl killed Asim bin Thabit and his companions. I say: hereby clear that al-Raji' place where Bani Lihyan betrayed companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, water for Hudhayl between Makkah and Usfan from head of al-Hada. As for Yaqut's saying near Taif: mistake from him because al-Raji' mentioned near al-Hada, not clear to Yaqut that al-Hada name of two places, one near Taif - this place with dal light - still known by this name. The other place with tashdid on dal silent, mentioned with hamza after dal also, this place near al-Raji' and Usfan, still known by its name and where Bani Lihyan betrayed companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, as in some narrations. Scholars' sayings agree on determining al-Raji' where the betrayal of companions occurred between Makkah and Usfan near al-Hada, these three places: Usfan, al-Raji', al-Hada close, and in drawing al-Hada more clarification, so look at it. Atik al-Biladi said known al-Raji' today as al-Watiya (al-Wata'a) water east of Usfan left of leaving Usfan to Makkah, its road branches 13 km from Usfan, distant from road about seven kilometers in lap of Hara al-Jabiriya, permanent water not dry, camels drink it with necks, drawn by buckets. Al-Raji' of common names called multiple places, among them preceding al-Raji', among them al-Raji' valley descended by the Prophet, peace be upon him, on his way to Khaybar when raided it, Ibn Ishaq mentioned in news of Khaybar expedition that peace be upon him when left the city to Khaybar took on Asr built for him mosque in it, then on al-Sahba then came until descended in valley called al-Raji', descended between them - meaning Jews of Khaybar - and Ghatafan to separate between them and aid people of Khaybar camped there, would go fighting Khaybar from it and left baggage at al-Raji' and women and wounded. Ibn Sa'd mentioned in news of Khaybar expedition that Amir bin al-Akwa' buried he and Mahmud bin Maslama from martyrs of Khaybar in one cave at al-Raji' in Khaybar.","Translation":"This story talks about a expedition sent by the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, to Al-Raji' between Mecca and Usfan, where Bani Lihyan betrayed and killed some companions."},{"Place":"Al-Rawha'","City":"Village on the Hajj road from the city to Makkah","Description":"Ra' silent waw silent then ha' silent ending with alif extended, and honor of al-Rawha' what rose from its land: village on Hajj road from the city to Makkah. Al-Bukhari narrated on the authority of Abdullah that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would descend at Dhi al-Hulayfa when intending Umrah and in his Hajj when hajj under acacia in place of the mosque at Dhi al-Hulayfa and when returned from raid in that road or Hajj or Umrah descended from belly of valley when emerged from belly of valley knelt at al-Batha' on edge of eastern valley rested then until morning not at mosque of stones nor on hill with mosque was then creek Abdullah prayed at it in its belly dune the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, prayed in it and Abdullah bin Umar narrated that the Prophet prayed where the small mosque below the mosque at honor of al-Rawha', and Abdullah knew the place where the Prophet, peace be upon him, prayed. Ibn Hajar said: honor of al-Rawha' comprehensive village two nights from the city, last of al-Siyala for heading to Makkah, middle mosque in valley known now as Wadi Bani Salim. In adhan from Sahih Muslim between them thirty-six miles. Al-Majd said: al-Rawha' place near the city, from works of al-Fur' about forty miles from the city. In Sahih Muslim bin al-Hajjaj thirty-six miles, in book of Ibn Abi Shayba thirty miles. Abu Ubayd al-Bakri: grave of Mudar bin Nizar at al-Rawha', two nights from the city between them forty-one miles. Asked Kathir: why named al-Rawha' al-Rawha': said for its openness and spirit, and spot rawha': good with scent. Bedouin woman said: if state width of sand O companion before them perhaps man seeks what not meeting God sees that heart became its conscience with what faced al-Rawha' and al-Arj said. Attribution to it Rawhawi, Ibn al-Radiya said: in every day you aiming its lands with eyes two drowning if my eyes overflowed my companions said indeed your eyes indulged in pouring so carry me bless God in you to present of al-Rawha' then leave me. Ibn Shabba narrated on authority of Kathir bin Abdullah bin Amr al-Muzani, from his father, from his grandfather: the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, prayed in mosque at belly of al-Rawha' at Arq al-Tabiya, then said: this Sajasij: valley from valleys of paradise. Al-Harbi said: from the city to Dhi al-Hulayfa five and half miles, from Dhi al-Hulayfa to al-Hafir six miles, from al-Hafir to Malal six miles, from Malal to al-Siyala seven miles, from the city to al-Siyala twenty-three miles from al-Siyala to al-Rawha' eleven miles from al-Rawha' to al-Ruwaytha thirteen miles, from al-Siyala to al-Ruwaytha twenty-four miles. At al-Rawha' wells Sawan and ponds they al-Muzayna, with two palaces large and small, many known wells among them well for Uthman bin Affan, well for Umar bin Abd al-Aziz, two ponds known as Muhammad bin Zubayda. Narrated on authority of Ibn Umar he would pray at the Arq at exit of al-Rawha' that the Arq ended its end on edge of road, below mosque between it and exit you going to Makkah, mosque built then Abdullah not pray in that mosque, leave it on his left and behind, pray at the Arq itself. Narrated from Ibn Jami' from Nadir that mosque from al-Rawha' on two miles mosque of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, informed that mosque called mosque of al-Munsarif, disconnected mountain on your left deviates from it. Ibn Hajar said: Munsarif al-Rawha': with fathah on ra' i.e. its end. Al-Waqidi in news of farewell Hajj: the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, became morning Sunday at Malal, then went supped at honor of al-Siyala, prayed at al-Sharf Maghrib and Isha, prayed Fajr at Arq al-Thabiya between al-Rawha' and al-Siyala - below al-Rawha' in mosque on right of road, then the Messenger of God descended al-Rawha' then went peace be upon him from al-Rawha' prayed Asr at al-Munsarif, then prayed Maghrib and Isha and supped there, prayed Fajr at al-Athaya. Al-Bakri said: al-Rawha' with fathah first with ha' silent extended comprehensive village for Muzayna, two nights from the city between them forty-one miles, attribution to it Rawhani on non-analogy, said Rawhawi on analogy, Kathir said: repellers at al-Rawha' sometimes and sometimes burrows Ridwa her valley and sands. I say: this what early historians mentioned about description of al-Rawha' and determining its location, distance between it and the city, not differed in control its name, nor in determining its place, occurred difference between them in determining distance between it and the city. Hamd al-Jasir said: al-Rawha': still known had ancient fame, narrated from the Prophet, peace be upon him, said while in Wadi al-Rawha' pointing to great mountain extended on left of heading to Makkah: what name this mountain? Said: (Warqan) said: its name Hamat mountain from mountains of paradise, O God bless us in it and bless its people in it, do you know what name this valley meaning Wadi al-Rawha'? This Sajasij indeed prayed in this mosque before me 70 prophets, indeed passed by it - meaning al-Rawha' - Musa bin Imran in 70 thousand from Bani Israel on him two Qatwan abbayas on his piebald she-camel and the hour not stand until Isa bin Maryam passes by it hajj or umrah, the hadith from narration of Ibn Zabala known his position with hadith scholars. For antiquity of al-Rawha' arose idea of existence of grave of Mudar bin Nizar in it, as al-Bakri indicated in (dictionary of what difficult). Observer sees west of well and mosque traces of old building and many graves there, al-Rawha' this distant from the city about 80 km, after al-Rawha' four kilometers traveler passes by end of mountain on his right called Arq al-Thabiya beside it ruined mosque and traces of graves at end of mosque, this mosque has mention with predecessors where count it and mosque of al-Rawha' from prophetic mosques, what concerns us from this indication to antiquity of these places. From al-Rawha' to al-Musayjid large village now 8 kilometers, al-Musayjid modern name, known anciently as al-Munsarif, with fathah on sad in it mosque known as mosque of al-Ghazala still known old also mentioned by al-Bukhari in his Sahih. Flood of Wadi al-Rawha' pours to al-Munsarif hence called Munsarif al-Rawha', meets with valleys of al-Naziya and Rahqan and Wadi al-Ji then these valleys overflow on al-Safra'. Old road deviates from al-Munsarif to left heading south leaving known road now on right. Atik al-Biladi said: al-Rawha': small village on seventy-three km from the city on Makkah road, remained station for camels, when cars came delayed and few its visitors, today two cafes, no farming, overlooks it from sunrise mount Warqan reddish with peaks, comes to it from north small valley known as Shanuka, overlooks it directly from south mount al-Jarf, with fathah on jim, from it see Arq al-Tabiya north to east road passes by it before it, second stage from the city, first was al-Siyala then became al-Farish, when al-Musayjid built after al-Rawha' seven kilometers al-Rawha' began to fade. Its people Awf from Harb or al-Hajla gather their homes in it.","Translation":"This story talks about Al-Rawha' village, an important station on Hajj road from Medina to Mecca, where the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, descended several times. Al-Rawha' is near Medina about eighty kilometers, distinguished by wells and historical ruins from ancient eras, like Uthman bin Affan's well and Umar bin Abdul Aziz's well. It also has old mosques and graves, including the Prophet's mosque, peace be upon him, a little away from the large mosque in Al-Rawha', part of Prophetic mosques. Al-Rawha' is between mountains like Mount Warqan and Mount Al-Jarf, known for specified distance from Medina now less compared to previous periods, leading to its importance decline for travelers. It was an important station for camels and cars anciently, now with two cafes, while still having ancient ruins and historical graves, making it a place of historical and religious importance.\""},{"Place":"Rawdat Khakh","City":"Between Makkah and the City","Description":"One of gardens, Khakh with dotted kha' then alif then another dotted kha': garden on road between Makkah and the city, near the city.

Said: I, said: say: said Khakh, Khakh, Khakh, Akh Akh, then spat on it as if clearing throat said: satirized by Lord of Ka'ba, for you the mule and what on you of clothes.

Al-Bukhari narrated on authority of al-Sa'ib bin Yazid said call on Friday first when imam sits on pulpit in time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and Abu Bakr and Umar, may God be pleased with them, when Uthman, may God be pleased with him, people increased added third call at al-Zawra'. Ibn Hajar said: al-Zawra' with fathah on zay sakin waw after ra' extended, at Ibn Khuzayma and Ibn Majah with word: added third call on house in market called al-Zawra'. In Sahih Muslim in hadith of Anas that prophet of God and his companions at al-Zawra', al-Zawra' in the city at market. Ibn Shabba narrated on authority said: narrated Abu Ghassan from Muhammad bin Ismail bin Abi Fudayk, informed me Yahya bin Muhammad bin al-Hakam bin Mina said: reached market at al-Zawra' called market of al-Hars people descend to it by stairs, meaning: in the city. Al-Majd said: al-Zawra': with fathah, place near market of the city elevated, said: name of market of the city. Al-Zawra' also name of house of Uthman bin Affan, may God be pleased with him. Al-Bakri said: al-Zawra' with fathah first extended: name occurs on several places, among them al-Zawra' connected to the city, where Uthman added third call on Friday when people increased. Yaqut said: Zawra', feminine of al-Azwar, tilted, and al-Izwarar from thing: deviation from it and inclination, al-Zawra' place at market of the city near mosque, al-Dawudi said: elevated like minaret, said: rather al-Zawra' market of the city itself, from it hadith of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, he heard shouting of people of al-Zawra', and it intended al-Farazdaq: longs at Zawra' of the city my camel longing of calf leaves the bow remnants O would Zawra' of the city become at Zawra' Falaj or at Sayf al-Kawazim. Al-Samhudi said: al-Zawra' with fathah then sakin. Ibn Shabba said in houses of al-Abbas: among them house at al-Zawra' market of the city at stones of oil. Abd al-Hamid al-Abbasi said: al-Zawra': with fathah then sakin place near market of the city elevated said: name of market of the city, al-Zawra' also name of house of Uthman bin Affan, may God be pleased with him, made call on it he innovated on Friday.. in side of Baqi' al-Khayl, there mosque of companions of abbas, there were stones of oil from market of the city not Baqi' al-Gharqad. I say: this what historians mentioned in determining location of al-Zawra' in the city, where called for Friday prayer and this place - al-Zawra' - became unknown in this era. Al-Bukhari narrated on authority of Anas bin Malik, may God be pleased with him: came to the Prophet, peace be upon him - vessel he at al-Zawra' - placed his hand in vessel water sprung from between his fingers people performed wudu, Qatada said: I said to Anas how many were you, said: three hundred or about three hundred. Ibn Hajar said: al-Zawra' with precedence of zay on ra' with extension, known place in the city at market. Claimed al-Dawudi elevated like minaret, as if took from Uthman's order to call at al-Zawra' not necessary, rather fact place Uthman ordered call in at al-Zawra', not al-Zawra' itself, occurred in narration of Hammam from Qatada from Anas: witnessed the Prophet, peace be upon him, with his companions at al-Zawra', or at houses of the city, extracted Abu Nu'aym. From Sharik bin Abi Namir from Anas he who brought water, brought it to the Prophet, peace be upon him, from house of Umm Salama, returned it after they finished to Umm Salama with amount what was in it first. From Ubayd Allah bin Umar from Thabit from Anas the Prophet, peace be upon him, went out to Quba', brought from some their houses small cup, occurred in hadith of Jabir coming explicit it in travel, in narration of Nabih al-Anzi at Ahmad from Jabir said we traveled with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, prayer came the Messenger of God said: is there in people purification? Man came with remainder in pitcher poured it in cup the Messenger of God performed wudu then people came with rest of purification said: wipe heard them the Messenger of God struck his hand in cup in bottom of vessel then said: complete purification, Jabir said: by who took my sight indeed saw water coming out from between fingers of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, until performed wudu all, thought he said: we two hundred or more. I say: thus occurred difference in al-Zawra' mentioned in this hadith is it al-Zawra' known in the city, or another place outside the city passed by the Prophet, peace be upon him, in one of his travels, not see mention for this place in Sira books talked about travels of the Prophet, peace be upon him, mention places passes by in his way in travel.

Al-Zawra' also house of Uthman bin Affan, may God be pleased with him, in the city. Al-Zawra' land at Dhi Khaym in saying of Tamim bin Muqbil: from people of Qarn not watered supper to lighted at al-Zawra' from Khaym al-Azhari said and city of al-Zawra' at Baghdad in eastern side, named al-Zawra' for inclination in its qibla, others said al-Zawra' city of Abu Ja'far al-Mansur, western side, correct than what al-Azhari went to by consensus of Sira people, said: named al-Zawra'; because when built made inner doors deviated from outer doors, i.e. not on its direction, in it some said farewell people of al-Zawra' deviate not deceived by affection from inhabitants of it it abode of peace think not desire from it except what said in it al-Zawra' house built by al-Nu'man bin al-Mundhir at al-Hira, Ibn al-Sakit said narrated me who saw it claimed Abu Ja'far al-Mansur demolished it, in it al-Nabigha says: and you spring revive people its flow and sword lent death cutter and water if wish without deprivation at Zawra' in its sides musk Kari'. Ibn al-Sakit said in saying of al-Nabigha: remained cuts of camels Mubila at cross on al-Zawra' erected al-Zawra': water for Bani Asad, al-Asma'i said al-Zawra' Rasafa of Hisham was for al-Nu'man where he was, to it ended his spoils, was Christian, resided by Bani Hanifa, nearest lands of Sham to shih and qaysum, said not for al-Zawra' water but they heard saying of the sayer: remained cuts of camels Mubila at cross on al-Zawra' erected thought water for them, not water there but erected cross for blessing.

Place six miles from Makkah said seven nine twelve, married there the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, Maymuna bint al-Harith, there built with her, there she died, in it Ubayd Allah bin Qays al-Ruqayyat said: not spoke with two Jahlas ruins recent covenant their people or old Sarf home for Salma so al-Dhahran from us homes so al-Qasim. Qadi Iyad said: as for what reserved in it Umar, may God be pleased with him, came he reserved al-Sarf and al-Rabdha, thus at al-Bukhari with silent sin, in Muwatta' Ibn Wahb al-Sharf; with dotted shin fathah on ra', thus narrated some narrators of al-Bukhari corrected it this correct. As for Sarf not enter it alif and lam, al-Harbi in interpretation of hadith: not like blow in prayer and that for me passage of al-Sharf, with dotted shin thus controlled said: singled it with goodness of its pasture God knows best. Al-Hazimi said: Sarf with fathah first with silent 'ayn at end water for Hudhayl, for Bani Lihyan from them, between Makkah and Usfan in Hijaz region, from head of al-Hada said Ibn Ishaq and others, Abu Dhuaib said: became from Umm Amr belly Marr so Ajza' al-Raji' then Dhu Sadr so Amlah and at al-Raji' Bani Lihyan from Hudhayl killed Asim bin Thabit and his companions. I say: hereby clear that al-Raji' place where Bani Lihyan betrayed companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, water for Hudhayl between Makkah and Usfan from head of al-Hada. As for Yaqut's saying near Taif: mistake from him because al-Raji' mentioned near al-Hada, not clear to Yaqut that al-Hada name of two places, one near Taif - this place with dal light - still known by this name. The other place with tashdid on dal silent, mentioned with hamza after dal also, this place near al-Raji' and Usfan, still known by its name and where Bani Lihyan betrayed companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, as in some narrations. Scholars' sayings agree on determining al-Raji' where betrayal of companions occurred between Makkah and Usfan near al-Hada, these three places: Usfan, al-Raji', al-Hada close, and in drawing al-Hada more clarification, so look at it. Atik al-Biladi said known al-Raji' today as al-Watiya (al-Wata'a) water east of Usfan left of leaving Usfan to Makkah, its road branches 13 km from Usfan, distant from road about seven kilometers in lap of Hara al-Jabiriya, permanent water not dry, camels drink it with necks, drawn by buckets. Al-Raji' of common names called multiple places, among them preceding al-Raji', among them al-Raji' valley descended by the Prophet, peace be upon him, on his way to Khaybar when raided it, Ibn Ishaq mentioned in news of Khaybar expedition that peace be upon him when left the city to Khaybar took on Asr built for him mosque in it, then on al-Sahba then came until descended in valley called al-Raji', descended between them - meaning Jews of Khaybar - and Ghatafan to separate between them and aid people of Khaybar camped there, would go fighting Khaybar from it and left baggage at al-Raji' and women and wounded. Ibn Sa'd mentioned in news of Khaybar expedition that Amir bin al-Akwa' buried he and Mahmud bin Maslama from martyrs of Khaybar in one cave at al-Raji' in Khaybar.","Translation":"This story talks about Wadi Saraf, a place on Hajj road from Medina to Mecca. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, married Maymunah bint Al-Harith there, died and buried in this place. Historians agreed the Prophet consummated with Maymunah in Saraf and she died and buried there, but differed on her death year. Saraf near Mecca with ten wells, small farms, small watering place with school, mosque, and shop."},{"Place":"Al-Suqya","City":"Mecca and Medina","Description":"A village on the pilgrimage route between Mecca and Medina. Al-Bukhari narrated through his chain from Abdullah ibn Abi Qatadah, who said: My father set out in the year of Al-Hudaybiyah, and his companions entered ihram while he did not. The Prophet (peace be upon him) was informed that an enemy was raiding him, so the Prophet (peace be upon him) set out. While I was with his companions, some of them laughing with each other, I looked and behold, there was a wild donkey. I charged at it, stabbed it, and immobilized it. I sought their help, but they refused to assist me. We ate from its meat and feared we might be cut off. I sought the Prophet (peace be upon him), sometimes raising my horse and sometimes walking. I met a man from Banu Ghifar in the middle of the night. I said: Where did you leave the Prophet (peace be upon him)? He said: I left him at Ta'ahun, and he is heading to Al-Suqya. Ibn Hajar said: Al-Suqya with damma on the silent letter, quiescence on the qaf, followed by a lower ya, shortened: a comprehensive village between Mecca and Medina. Al-Harbi said: From Al-Arj to Al-Suqya is seventeen miles, and at Al-Arj there are many wells. Before Al-Suqya, about a mile away, is Wadi Al-A'id. Kathir Azza said: It was named Al-Suqya because of the fresh water they were given there. From Al-Suqya to Al-Abwa' is seventeen miles. At Al-Suqya, there is a mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him) next to the mountain, and near it a spring that flows to the charities of Al-Husayn. It has many palm trees, and a mile from the village in a place called Askar, there are farms of palm trees for the charities of Al-Husayn ibn Zayd, with thirty wells lined with wood where various vegetables are grown, and there are another fifty wells built during the caliphate of Al-Mutawakkil. Their water is fresh, and they are close to water. Three miles from Al-Suqya is a ruined spring called Ta'ahun. The commentator said: I say: Al-Suqya is now known as Umm Al-Barak due to the abundance of pools there. It was a strong village two years ago—meaning from his visit—because it was on the Mecca-Medina road, but this road was diverted to the coast, so passage through it became rare. Al-Majd said: Al-Suqya with damma and quiescence on the second letter: a name from the rain that watered it, and he watered it. It is the name of a comprehensive village in the district of Al-Fur'. Two days from Medina. We narrated from the hadith of Abdul Aziz ibn Muhammad Al-Darawardi, from Hisham ibn Urwah, from his father, from Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her): That the Messenger of Allah used to draw fresh water from the houses of Al-Suqya, and in another hadith: He used to sweeten the fresh water from the houses of Al-Suqya. In Al-Nihayah: Al-Suqya is a station between Mecca and Medina, said to be two days from Medina. From it is the hadith: That he used to sweeten water for him from the houses of Al-Suqya. Abu Bakr ibn Musa said: Al-Suqya is a well in Medina from which water was drawn for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). This is interpreted as such because Al-Fur' is part of Medina's district. As for the well at the gate of Medina between it and Thaniyat Al-Wada', on the left of the traveler to Dhi Al-Hulayfah, and the people of Medina think it is the Al-Suqya mentioned in the hadith, it appears to be a mistake. What confirms this is the saying in the hadith: from the houses of Al-Suqya, and there were no houses at this well at that time, nor was that found. Also, water was sweetened for him from Al-Suqya when they found Medina's wells brackish. This well we mentioned belonged to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him), as narrated by Sheikh Jamal Al-Din Al-Matri. He said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) reviewed the army of Badr at Al-Suqya which belonged to Sa'd, prayed in its mosque, and supplicated there for the people of Medina to bless their mudd and sa', and to bring them provision from here, here, and here. He drank (peace be upon him) from its well, and its land is called Al-Filjan, with damma on fa and jim. Today it is abandoned, and it was a deep well, repaired by some poor foreigners in these years. Ibn Al-Faqih said: Al-Suqya is from the lower valleys of Tihamah. Ibn Al-Kalbi said: When Tubba' returned from Medina heading to Mecca, he descended at Al-Suqya and was thirsty, then rain fell upon him, so he named it Al-Suqya. Al-Khwarizmi said: Al-Suqya is a village near the sea, a day's and night's journey away. I say: In what Al-Majd said, there is confusion between Al-Suqya in Medina—where the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) reviewed the army of Badr and from which water was drawn for him—and Al-Suqya on the road between Mecca and Medina, two days from Medina—which is the place we are discussing. He strived to reconcile the statements and interpret some based on others to make them one place. Yaqut said: Suqya with damma on the first and quiescence on the second. It is said: I watered so-and-so and gave him drink, meaning I said to him \"suqya\" with fatha. Allah watered him with rain and gave him drink. The name is Al-Suqya with damma. Kathir was asked why Al-Suqya was named so? He said: Because they were watered with fresh water there. Narrated to us Abdul Aziz ibn Al-Akhdar, informed us Yahya ibn Thabit ibn Bundar, narrated Al-Barqani, narrated Abu Bakr ibn Jamil Al-Harawi, informed us Abdullah ibn Urwah, informed us Salih ibn Harzah, who said: Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: Abdul Aziz ibn Muhammad Al-Darawardi is weak in hadith. He narrated from Hisham ibn Urwah from his father from Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to draw fresh water from the houses of Al-Suqya, and in another hadith: He used to sweeten water from the houses of Al-Suqya. Al-Suqya: a comprehensive village in the district of Al-Fur', between it and Al-Juhfah nineteen miles according to some, and in Al-Khwarizmi's book: twenty-nine miles. Ibn Al-Faqih said: Al-Suqya is from the lower valleys of Tihamah. I say: Thus we see that Yaqut confused the two places, just as Al-Majd did. I say: This is what some early historians mentioned in defining the village of Al-Suqya, located on the pilgrimage route between Mecca and Medina, which in this era has become known as Umm Al-Barak, plural of Barakah. Atiq Al-Biladi said: Umm Al-Barak, plural of Barakah: a town that was known as Al-Suqya, remained a station for caravans between Mecca and Medina, then named Umm Al-Barak for the watering places established there. Cars passed through it in its early days, but after the road was diverted to the coast, the town declined. It appeared to me in 1393 AH as heavily ruined with few inhabitants. It has an elementary school and telegraph, its people are slaves, and its administration is under Wadi Al-Fur' at 53 km. Umm Al-Barak is 39 km from Bir Mubeirik and 12 km northeast from Masturah. Hamd Al-Jasir said: Umm Al-Barak, plural of Barakah, a village that was large but has weakened now. It was formerly called Al-Suqya, with silent sin emphasized damma, followed by quiescent qaf, then lower ya open extended. It is Suqya of Banu Ghifar, a known tribe formerly, one of their dwellings in ancient times. The upper parts of Al-Suqya begin from a place about 45 km after Umm Al-Barak for those heading to Medina, at a place called Al-Rasfah, a mountain carved anciently for travelers, its ground paved. Al-Suqya: like the previous. Al-Waqidi said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) went out with those with him until he reached Naqab Bani Dinar, then descended at Al-Baq' which is the houses of Al-Suqya. Al-Baq' is Naqab Bani Dinar in Medina, and Al-Suqya is connected to the houses of Medina on Sunday, twelve days into Ramadan. He set up his camp there and reviewed the fighters. Narrated through his chain from Abu Qatadah from his father, that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) at the houses of Al-Suqya, and supplicated that day for the people of Medina, saying: O Allah, Abraham Your servant, friend, and prophet supplicated You for the people of Mecca, and I Muhammad Your servant and prophet supplicate You for the people of Medina to bless their sa' and mudd and fruits. O Allah, make us love Medina and move any plague in it to Khumm. O Allah, You have forbidden what is between its two lava fields as Abraham forbade Mecca, and Khumm is two miles from Al-Juhfah. He said: Ali ibn Abi Al-Zaghab and Babsas ibn Amr came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) from the houses of Al-Suqya. They said: Abdullah ibn Amr ibn Haram came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that day and said: O Messenger of Allah, I am pleased with this your station and your review of your companions in it, and I take it as a good omen. This is our station—Banu Salimah—where what was between us and the people of Husaykah happened. Husaykah is the flies, and Al-Dhubab is a mountain in the area of Medina, and there were Jews at Husaykah with many dwellings. We reviewed our companions here, approved those who could bear arms, and returned those too young, then we went to the Jews of Husaykah who were the strongest Jews then, and killed them as we wished. The rest of the Jews submitted to us until today. I hope, O Messenger of Allah, that we meet Quraysh and Allah pleases your eye with them. Khallad ibn Amr ibn Al-Jamuh said: When it was daytime, he returned to his family at Khazbi, his father Amr ibn Al-Jamuh said to him: I thought you had set out. He said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) is reviewing the people at Al-Baq'. Amr said: Good omen, by Allah, I hope you gain booty and triumph over the polytheists of Quraysh. This is our station when we set out from Husaykah. He said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) changed its name and called it Al-Suqya. He said: It was in my mind to buy it, until Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas bought it with two camels, or said seven ounces. He said: It was mentioned to the Prophet (peace be upon him) that Sa'd bought it, so he said: Profitable trade. They said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) departed in the evening of Sunday, twelve days into Ramadan from the houses of Al-Suqya, and the Muslims went out with him, three hundred and five, eight stayed behind, he drew lots for them and their rewards. The camels were seventy. Al-Matri said: Al-Suqya belonged to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him). It is narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) reviewed the army of Badr at Al-Suqya which belonged to Sa'd, prayed in its mosque, supplicated for the people of Medina to bless their mudd and sa', and bring provision from here, here, and here. He drank (peace be upon him) from its well, and its land is called Al-Filjan. Today it is ruined and abandoned, a sweet large well carved in the mountain. Hafiz Abdul Ghani narrated that he reviewed his army at Bir Anabah on the Harrah above this well to the west, said to be a mile from Medina. Ibn Shabbah narrated through his chain from Hisham ibn Urwah from his father from Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her): The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to have fresh water drawn for him from the well of Al-Suqya. Harun said: from the houses of Al-Suqya. Narrated through his chain from Jabir ibn Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: My father said: O son, we intercepted here at Al-Suqya until we faced the Jews at Husaykah, triumphed over them while hoping to triumph. Then we reviewed the Prophet (peace be upon him) there heading to Badr. If I survive and return, I will buy it; if killed, do not miss it. He said: I went to buy it and found it belonging to Dhakwan ibn Abd Qays, and found Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas had bought it first. Its land's name was Al-Filjan, and the well's name Al-Suqya. I asked Abdul Aziz ibn Imran: Which Husaykah? He said: The area of Ibn Maqiyah's land, to Qasr Ibn Abi Amr Al-Ramid, to Qasr Ibn Al-Mushma'il, to the lowest Al-Jarf all. He said: In it the poet says: We attacked them at the foot on the day of Husaykah \/ Plates of Basri and the brown Radiniyah \/ No one stood for our clash \/ Nor did our raiders when we drove them drive. Abu Ghassan said: Abdul Aziz ibn Imran informed me from Rashid ibn Hafs from his father, who said: The land of Al-Suqya's name is Al-Falj, its well's name Al-Suqya, belonged to Dhakwan ibn Abd Qays Al-Zarqi, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas bought it from him with two camels. Al-Samhudi said: Al-Waqidi narrated from the hadith of Salimah, wife of Abu Rafi', who said: Abu Ayyub, when the Prophet (peace be upon him) stayed with him, used to sweeten water for him from the well of Malik ibn Al-Nadr, father of Anas. Then Anas, Hind, and Harithah sons of Asma' carried water to his wives' houses from the houses of Al-Suqya. Rabah Al-Aswad with him (peace be upon him) drew for him from Bir Ghars sometimes, and from the houses of Al-Suqya sometimes. Al-Tirmidhi narrated: And said hasan sahih from Ali ibn Abi Talib, who said: We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) until we were at Harrah Al-Suqya which belonged to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Bring me water for ablution. He performed ablution, stood, faced the Qiblah, the hadith. Al-Samhudi said: This well of Al-Suqya is the one Al-Matri mentioned at the end of Manzilat Al-Naqa' on the left of the traveler to Bir Ali in ihram. He said: It is a sweet large well carved in the mountain, now abandoned and ruined. On its northern side—meaning west—a rectangular plastered building. Apparently, it was a basin or pool for pilgrims' watering, they used to descend there in the days of Medina's prosperity. Thus Al-Matri called its location Manzilat Al-Naqa'. Some poor foreigners renewed it in 778 AH, so it became known as Bir Al-A'jam, as I saw in the handwriting of Al-Zayn Al-Maraghi. It deteriorated and scattered after that, renewed by Janab Al-Khwajak Al-Badri Badr Al-Din ibn Alibah in 886 AH, may Allah accept from him and reward him Paradise by His grace and generosity. I say: Al-Samhudi prolonged the discussion about this well—this is some of what he said—and detailed his account refuting Al-Majd and those who followed him in confusing this well in Medina with Al-Suqya on the pilgrimage route between Mecca and Medina, making them one place. Ahmad Al-Abbasi said: Al-Suqya with damma then quiescence, feminine of the name from the rain that watered him and gave him drink. Name of a comprehensive village in the districts of Al-Fur', two days from Medina. Named so because they were watered with fresh water there. It has a spring and wells. Said: Tubba' was thirsty when he descended there, rained, so named it Al-Suqya. Al-Suqya is a well in Medina called Al-Suqya, its land called Al-Filjan with damma on fa. I say: In the preceding statements of historians, there is sufficiency in defining the well of Al-Suqya in Medina, and refutation of those who said otherwise. Abdul Quddus Al-Ansari said: Well of Al-Suqya: Location of this well south of the railway station building, separated by the Mecca road. The spot with the well is called Al-Filjan. It was dwellings for pilgrims visiting Medina at this well. Renewed by some Persians in 778 AH, known in some Medina histories as Bir Al-A'jam. It is deep, carved in rock, diameter six meters, depth fourteen meters, south of it its farm. Well of Al-Suqya is narrated, the Prophet (peace be upon him) drank from its water and performed ablution, on its land Al-Filjan he reviewed the army going to Badr. It belonged to Dhakwan Al-Zarqi, bought by Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas. Al-Shanqiti said: In his discussion of the western Harrah of Medina, there is the Al-Naqa' area, a balanced place in this Harrah, distinguished by pure air and sweet well water. There is the land of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas which the railway station wall includes most of, inside this wall from its southern side is Masjid Al-Suqya with three domes, the middle largest. This mosque was built at the site of the Prophet's (peace be upon him) dome when going out for Badr and reviewing his army... This mosque is renovated now, clean, with an imam from the Ministry of Endowments. East of this mosque was the well of Al-Suqya from which water was sweetened for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). Al-Suqya also: Yaqut said: Al-Asma'i said in the book of the Arabian Peninsula mentioning Mecca and around it: Al-Suqya is the channel that empties into Arafah and Masjid Ibrahim. In Abu Ubayd Al-Sukuni's book: Al-Suqya is a pool and thick reservoir below Samira' for the ascender to Mecca, between Al-Suqya and Samira' four miles. Al-Suqya: a village at the gate of Manbij, with many orchards and running waters, endowed to the children of Abu Ubadah Al-Buhturi until now.","Translation":"This story talks about Bir Al-Suqya in Medina, also known as \"Umm Al-Barak.\" The well between Mecca and Medina, important station for caravans.

Al-Bukhari narrated from Anas ibn Malik that a man entered on Friday from a door facing the pulpit while the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was standing delivering the sermon. He faced the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) standing and said: O Messenger of Allah, the livestock perished, roads cut off, supplicate Allah to send rain. He said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) raised his hands and said: O Allah, water us, O Allah, water us, O Allah, water us. Anas said: By Allah, we saw no cloud in the sky, no fragment, nothing. Between us and Sal' no house or dwelling. A cloud like a shield emerged from behind it, when in the middle of the sky it spread then rained. By Allah, we did not see the sun for a week. Ibn Hajar said: Sal' with fatha on the silent, quiescence on lam, known in Medina, narrated that with fatha on lam. Al-Bakri said: Sal' with fatha on first, quiescence on second, then silent 'ayn: a mountain connected to Medina. In the hadith of Istisqa' from Yahya ibn Sa'id from Anas ibn Malik, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: (O Allah, send us relief). Anas said: By Allah, we saw no cloud or fragment in the sky, between us and Sal' no house or dwelling, a cloud like a shield emerged from behind it, when in middle it spread then rained. Al-Sal' and Al-Sala' are dialects, a crack in the mountain like a fissure. Al-A'sha said: Like a snake of Sal' from the killers \/ It precedes the sharpness from it a shirt. Yaqut said: Sal' with fatha on first, quiescence on second. Al-Sulu': cracks in mountains, one of them Sal' and Salla'. Abu Zayd said: Al-Asla' are edges in mountains, one called Sal'a. Sal': a mountain at Medina's market. Al-Azhari said: Sal' a place near Medina. Abu Bakr ibn Durayd narrated from Al-Thawri from Al-Asma'i: Hababah, slave girl of Yazid ibn Abd Al-Malik, sang, she was the most beautiful face and heard, he was intensely fond of her, raised in Medina: By your life, I love Sal' \/ For seeing it and around Sal' \/ My eye rests near it, I fear \/ He intends my bereavement \/ I swear by the Lord of Mecca and the prayer place \/ And hands of swimmers on the morning of Jam' \/ You on distance, know it \/ Dearer to me than my sight and hearing. The poem is by Qays ibn Dharih. Then she sighed deeply. He said: Why sigh? By Allah, if you wanted it, I would uproot it to you stone by stone. She said: What do I do with it? I want its inhabitants. Ibn Al-Salmani said: Ibrahim ibn Arabi, governor of Al-Yamamah, was seized and taken chained to Medina. When passing Sal' he said: By your life, on the day of Sal' I blame \/ Myself but what does blame return? \/ I enabled my enemy his delusion \/ Alas for what passed if I knew \/ If the outcomes of matters appear to the youth \/ Like his heels he would not regret \/ The life, there were wide expanses \/ And night with black wings dark \/ When the earth knew not its gaps on me \/ And I have from the house of humiliation a refuge. Al-Waqidi narrated through his chain from Abu Bakr ibn Abdullah ibn Jaham: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) rode his horse—with some companions from Muhajirun and Ansar—scouting a place to descend, the most pleasing station to him was to put Sal' behind his back, and dig a trench from Al-Mudad to Dhubab to Ratij, meaning in the Battle of the Trench. Narrated from Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Sahl from his father from his grandfather: I saw the Muslims and youth carrying soil, the trench a span or so. Muhajirun and Ansar carried on their heads in baskets. When returning with baskets, they put stones in them, bringing from Mount Sal'. They put soil towards the Prophet (peace be upon him) and companions, lined stones towards them like date ropes. Stones were their greatest weapon, throwing at them. Al-Abbasi said: Sal' with fatha then quiescence, ending silent 'ayn, market mountain of Medina, west of the shrine of Al-Nafs Al-Zakiyyah. Opposite its western edge is the cave of Banu Haram east of Bathan. Under the cave is a mosque in the valley, Masjid Banu Haram on the right of the traveler to Masajid Al-Fath on the western road. West of this cave is Mount Banu Ubayd, Husn Khall, and palms of Jabir ibn Abdullah. I say: This is Mount Sal' in Medina, described and defined, agreed upon by historians' statements. It is still known by its name, marked on Medina's maps. Abdul Quddus Al-Ansari described and located it: Mount Sal': a great lofty high mountain north of Medina, about five minutes away. Its stones are generally black, crumble under hand pressure. East of it is Dakkat Jalal, built by a person named so. On its western slope is the cave of Banu Haram where the Prophet (peace be upon him) spent nights before the verse of protection: {And Allah will protect you from the people} [Surah Al-Ma'idah: 67]. North of this cave on the mountain slope also is Masjid Al-Fath. I say: His saying: about five minutes away, this was when he authored his book, before Medina's urban expansion. Al-Shanqiti said: Sal' is a mountain northwest of Mount Suli', separated by Thaniyat Al-Ath'ath, in its eastern curve is the children's and women's hospital, extending north a level plain called Al-Atal until northern Thaniyat Al-Wada'. South of Mount Sal' is a ravine whose torrent descends to Al-Sayh (Bathan), now with Al-Nasiriyyah elementary school. On the western slope of Mount Sal' on the right of going to Masajid Al-Fath is the cave of Banu Haram at the end of their eastern ravine. The Prophet (peace be upon him) spent nights guarded during the Trench before leaving guards. In the ravine of Banu Haram, still known as Al-Amari relative to a man who owned its land in our era and sold to residents, is Masjid Banu Haram still known, renewed, five prayers held with imam from Ministry of Endowments. Among poetry said in it: Would I spend a night at Sal' \/ Its paths not closed on me. Another said: And a tribe between Al-Arid and Sal' \/ Where Islam anchored its pegs \/ Dearest to me near neighbor \/ Than Christians in their houses idols. Sal' also: Yaqut said: Sal' a fortress in Wadi Musa peace be upon him, near Jerusalem. Sal' a mountain in Hudhayl lands. Al-Bariq Al-Hudhali said: May the Merciful water the determination of springs \/ From Al-Jawza' abundant rains \/ At Murtahiz like on its peaks \/ Camels of Sham carrying spices \/ Drops the burdens from flanks of Sha'r \/ Left no donkey at Dhi Sal'. Atiq Al-Biladi commented: Sal' mentioned in Hudhayl lands: a mountain at the edge of Wadi Arnah from west south of Almi road to Najd, shaded by Al-Tariqi in evening. It is from eastern Haram boundaries and western Maghmas boundaries. Its people today Quraysh, pronounced with kasra on sin. As for Sha'r in the poem, he said: Plural Sha'ra' connected mountains near Sal' of Hudhayl or Quraysh today from south. Sal': Yaqut said with movement: Dhu Sal' a place between Najd and Hijaz. Abu Dawad Al-Iyadi said: And rain climbed from it the winds \/ Clouds at night and heavy clouds \/ When south winds rumbled it \/ Lean from it facing \/ Settled at Dhu Sal' a pool you think \/ Lightning in it torches. End. Sal' also: with quiescence on lam. Atiq Al-Biladi said: They pronounce with kasra on sin, mountain east of Al-Wajh by three stages. The road from Al-Wajh to Al-Bad' trod it, has a very difficult pass called Al-Bawq, from Bali lands. I say: Sal' Al-Rayan: a road piercing Mount Thahlan from east to west, south of Al-Shu'ara' town about five kilometers. Named after Ma' Al-Rayan nearby east of Thahlan.","Translation":"This story talks about Mount Sala' in Medina, a famous mountain in Islam's history and Battle of the Trench site.

I say: this some what Yaqut mentioned in his talk about lands of al-Sham, mentioned in his talk much news and poetry our place not allow mentioning, conquest of all lands of al-Sham completed in caliphate of Umar bin al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, by number of leaders, among them Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas, Abu Ubayda bin al-Jarrah, Khalid bin al-Walid and others - may God be pleased with them all. Al-Baladhuri talked in his book (conquests of countries) about conquest of lands of al-Sham, talked about conquest of each city from its cities in its drawing. Thus see in what historians mentioned name of al-Sham included what between Euphrates to al-Arish, but its division to four states: Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon, came late after Crusader wars tore lands of al-Sham to emirates to achieve ambitions of usurping Crusader princes, facilitate control on these lands, suffice with this amount about lands of al-Sham for its fame and availability what authored about it of books talk about it in its past and present.","Translation":"This story talks about the Levant lands' history and reputation, including lands extending between Euphrates to Al-Arish.

Al-Bukhari narrated on authority of Aisha, may God be pleased with her: when the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, came the city fevered Abu Bakr and Bilal when fever took Abu Bakr said: every man morning in his family and death nearer than lace of his sandal and Bilal when fever left him raises his voice says: O would know spend night in valley around me idhkhir and jalil and descend day waters of Majanna and appear to me Shama and Tafil al-Fakihi said: Shama and Tafil two mountains outside Makkah about thirty miles from Makkah. Yaqut said: Shama with word al-Shama, color opposing what adjoins it condition little in much mountain near Makkah adjoins it another called Tafil, in them Bilal says. Al-Khattabi said: thought them two mountains until ascertained them two springs, if two springs interpretation fa'il meaning maf'ul like qatil meaning maqtul, there blocks them sun as if maf'ulan, famous them two mountains overlooking Majanna post from Makkah. Abu Umar said: said one at Jeddah, for them mention in poetry of Bilal. Al-Asma'i in book of peninsula mercy what for Bani Ma al-Dawil particular, mountain called Tafil, Shama mountain beside Tafil. I say: Yaqut's saying overlooking Majanna post from Makkah not correct; because Tafil and Shama located southwest Makkah distant (75) km, Majanna east Makkah. Atik al-Biladi said: Shama mountain southwest Makkah, about ninety km, pours Wadi al-Bayda' north and Wadi Adam pours on it and on Tafil pours south Wadi Yalamlam, adjoins it north mountain Shama which Bilal coupled with it in his poetry, Shama and Tafil in lands of al-Jahadila from Bani Shu'ba from remnants of Kinana, was from their lands ancient and modern. These two mountains overlook west on khabt Muhayrima extends to sea, if stand at foot of one from west see al-Sawa'i in sea. Hamd al-Jasir said: when Yemen pilgrims pass miqat of ihram known anciently as Yalamlam modernly as al-Sa'diya and Lamlum, when pass place of ihram descend in wide khabt see from it on their left small mountain in khabt called Tafila, between it and sea black towering mountain called (Shama) (drawn in map Hara Shama error). Muhammad bin Bulayhid said: commenting on poetry of Bilal, may God be pleased with him: Shama and Tafil in Tihama, between al-Lith and Jeddah, mountains not changed their names to this era. Said in another place from his book commenting on what Yaqut mentioned in determining Tafil: reviewed these narrations and their conflict and difference, if want review accuracy of its news and determine its location it in khabt from Tihama, between Jeddah and Muhayrima, between sea and chain of mountains... two mountains opposite, one toward sunrise, other toward sunset, as for Tafil small mountain has hump in it abariq, as for Shama piece of black lava. I say: in what mentioned in two places something of difference, not understood from it clear determination for these two mountains, since these two mountains still known by their names remaining on that facilitates knowing their location in Tihama, between Makkah and al-Sa'idah, place where Yemen pilgrim ihrams from. In drawing Tafil more clarification, so look at it. Shama also, said: al-Shamat collect Shama said Amr bin Kulthum in his mu'allaqa: we descended homes at Dhi Tuluh to al-Shamat expels al-Maw'id Yana had passed by these al-Shamat year 1395 AH in our journey with Hamd al-Jasir, witnessed its landmarks after leaving settlement (al-Ajfar) heading east with old Hajj road crossed Arq al-Abaytir, then descended in (Khab al-Hasak) flat desert, then crossed Arq al-Ash'ali descended in Shamat Zurud, then crossed Arq Lizam after it Shamat Mughaylith, connected to it Shamat Akbad, then descended from Arq al-Mazhur on water al-Bad' (al-Tha'labiya) anciently.

Nafi' narrated from Ibn Umar, may God be pleased with them, prayed in those places Salim informed only agreed Nafi' in places all except differed in mosque at honor of al-Rawha'. Ibn Hajar said: honor of al-Rawha' comprehensive village two nights from the city, last of al-Siyala for heading to Makkah. Al-Waqidi said: Aisha said: became morning the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, Sunday at Malal, then went supped at honor of al-Siyala, prayed Fajr at Arq al-Thabiya between al-Rawha' and al-Siyala - below al-Rawha' in mosque on right of road, then descended the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, al-Rawha'. Al-Maraghi in mention of mosques prayed in by the Prophet, peace be upon him, between Makkah and the city: mosque at honor of al-Rawha', on chain of Ibn al-Zubayr to Abdullah said: prayed the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, at honor of al-Rawha' right of road you going to Makkah, left of it you coming from Makkah.

Then descend in Wadi al-Rawha' known today as Wadi Bani Salim, belly from Harb Arabs of Hijaz. In al-Maghanim al-Mutaba said al-Majd: al-Sharf moving, for high place: place between Malal and al-Rawha' near the city. In hadith of Aisha, may God be pleased with her: became morning the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, Sunday at Malal, one night from the city then went supped at honor of al-Siyala prayed Fajr at Arq al-Thabiya.

From al-Siyala to al-Rawha' eleven miles, at al-Siyala many known wells... Narrated me Ibn Abi Sa'd from Muhammad bin Ishaq, from Abu Damra from Musa bin Uqba from Nafi' that Ibn Umar narrated that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, prayed where small mosque below mosque overlooks al-Rawha', Ibn Umar knew place where the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, prayed. Yaqut said: Sharaf al-Siyala: between Malal and al-Rawha', mentioned hadith of Aisha preceding. Al-Samhudi said: al-Sharf moving: high place, honor of al-Rawha' and honor of al-Siyala; being end of al-Siyala, first of Wadi al-Rawha'. I say: thus agreed sayings of scholars in determining location of al-Sharf and distance between it and the city, as clear from their sayings: honor of al-Rawha' honor of al-Siyala, for being located between them representing end of each toward other, therefore attributed to al-Rawha' sometimes attributed to al-Siyala other.

One of the best grazing lands, the heart of Najd as early Arabs say, between Wadi Al-Rasha (Al-Tasrir anciently) and Al-Harir (Al-Jurayb anciently), its center Hima Dariyah. Al-Hijri said: Al-Zuhri narrated that Umar reserved Al-Sharaf and Al-Rabadhah, mentioned by Al-Bukhari. I say: Hima Al-Rabadhah west of Al-Sharaf, Uthman expanded Hima Al-Rabadhah as did governors after until vast lands entered it. I have detailed it in its entry, see it.

In Al-Sharaf is Al-Rabadhah the right Hima and Al-Sharif, beside it separated by Al-Tasrir. What is eastern is Al-Sharif, western Al-Sharaf.

Aws ibn Hajar mentioned a camel: Sharafiyyah from what waters a spring \/ At Quraynah or without companion. Attributed to Al-Sharaf, meaning from enemies' camels they seize.

Al-Bukhari said: Mujahid said Al-Arim is the dam, a red water that Allah sent into the dam, so it split it, demolished it, and dug the valley, and the water was not red from the dam but a punishment that Allah sent upon them from wherever He willed. Ibn Jarir narrated with his chain from Wahb bin Munabbih the Yemeni: Allah sent thirteen prophets to Saba', but they denied them (So We sent upon them the flood of the dam). He, the Exalted and Glorious, says: So We breached upon them, when they turned away from believing Our messengers, their dam which used to hold back the floods from them. And Al-Arim is the barriers that hold water, the singular is Arimah, and it is what Al-A'sha meant by his saying: In that there is a consolation for the consoler, and Ma'rib has been effaced by Al-Arim, marble built for them by Himyar, until their water came, it did not overflow. And Al-Arim was, as mentioned, among what was built by Bilqis, and it is narrated with his chain from Abu Maysarah regarding His saying, the Exalted: (We sent upon them the flood of the dam) he said: The barrier in the Yemeni dialect. And with his chain from Mujahid regarding His saying: (The flood of the dam) he said: Severe. And it is said: Al-Arim is the name of a valley that belonged to these people. And with his chain from Qatadah: (We sent upon them the flood of the dam) it was mentioned to us that the flood of Al-Arim is a valley where floods from various valleys would gather, so they built a dam between the two mountains with pitch and stones, and made doors on it, and they would take from its water what they needed and close off what they did not need from its water. And with his chain from Ibn Abbas: His saying: (The flood of the dam) he says: The severe, and the cause that Allah caused for sending that flood upon them, as mentioned to me, was a rat that Allah dispatched to their dam and pierced a hole in it. Ibn Kathir said: And the matter of the dam was that water would come to them from between two mountains, and the floods of their rains and valleys would also gather to it. So their ancient kings built between them a great, sturdy dam until the water rose and leveled with the edges of those two mountains, so they planted trees and harvested fruits in the utmost abundance and beauty, as mentioned by more than one of the predecessors - among them Qatadah - that a woman would walk under the trees with a basket or a large basket on her head, which she would use to pick fruits, and fruits would fall into it from the trees without needing effort or picking, due to its abundance, ripeness, and perfection. And this dam was in Ma'rib, a town between it and Sana'a three stages away, and it is known as the Ma'rib Dam. And His saying, the Exalted: (We sent upon them the flood of the dam): The intended by Al-Arim is the waters, and it is said: The valley, and it is said: The rat, and it is said: Abundant water. And more than one mentioned - among them Ibn Abbas, Wahb bin Munabbih, Qatadah, and Al-Dahhak - that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, when He wanted to punish them by sending Al-Arim upon them, sent upon the dam a creature from the earth called the rat, which burrowed into it. Wahb bin Munabbih said: And they used to find in their books that the cause of the destruction of this dam is the rat, so they would station cats there for a period of time, but when the decree came, the rat overcame the cats and entered the dam and burrowed into it, so it collapsed upon them. And Qatadah and others said: The rat is the mole, which burrowed into its foundations until it weakened and deteriorated, and when the days of floods came, the water struck the structure and it fell, so the water flowed into the bottom of the valley, destroying what was in front of it of buildings, trees, and other things, and the water drained from the trees on the two mountains to the right and left, so they dried up and shattered. And Al-Suhayli said: This dam was built by Saba' bin Yashjub bin Ya'rub, and he directed seventy valleys to it, and he died before completing it, so the kings of Himyar completed it after him. And Al-Mas'udi said: It was built by Luqman bin Ad and made it a farsakh, and made thirty outlets for it. And Al-A'sha said: In that there is a consolation for the consoler, and Ma'rib has been effaced by Al-Arim, marble built for them by Himyar, when their water came, it did not overflow, so it irrigated the crops and their grapes, with the vastness of their water when divided. So they became scattered groups, unable to take from it even enough for the drinking of a weaned child. And Al-Qazwini said: Ma'rib: A district between Hadramaut and Sana'a, nothing remains inhabited there except three villages called al-Durub, each village attributed to a tribe from Yemen, and they cultivate on the water that comes from the direction of the dam, irrigating their land with one irrigation, and planting on it three times each year. So between planting barley and harvesting it in that place is about two months, and there was the flood of Al-Arim mentioned in Saba'. And they mentioned that the waters of its mountains gather there and many floods, and it has one outlet, so the ancients dammed that outlet with a sturdy dam, and made outlets for it to take what they needed, so the waters gathered over a long time and became a great sea outside the dam, and inside it buildings, orchards, and farms, so Allah set the rat upon the dam digging it with its teeth and uprooting it with its claws until nothing remained except what was on the tops of the mountains, and the gardens, paradises, estates, and palaces went away, and the flood came with sand and covered them, and it is like that to this day as Allah, the Exalted, informed, so Allah made them tales and scattered them every scattering. And Yaqut spoke about Ma'rib and the Ma'rib Dam at length, which this place does not allow to mention. And what is in it about the dam does not depart from what preceded in this from the sayings of the scholars. I say: This is the Ma'rib Dam, located in the land of Saba', and Allah narrated the story of this dam and what befell it of destruction, and what happened to the people of that land of scattering and dispersion in the lands, as a lesson for those who reflect and an admonition for those who take heed, and the verses that detail their story are in Surah (Saba').","Translation":"This story talks about Ma'rib dam built by Saba people, where God sent Arim flood on them as punishment for denying messengers. Water gathered from multiple valleys to this firm dam, leading to fertile agriculture and fruit trees. But when rats and rodents sent, they burrowed the dam, water collapsed on buildings and trees. Quran mentioned this story as warning to others, place became lesson for people after dam destruction, Saba people's extinction, and dispersion in land."},{"Place":"Asfan","City":"Between Mecca the Honored and Jeddah","Description":"A town on the road between Mecca and Medina. Al-Bukhari narrated with his chain from Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib: Ali and Uthman, may Allah be pleased with them, differed while they were in Asfan regarding mut'ah, so he said: What do you want until you forbid a matter that the Prophet, peace be upon him, did? When Ali saw that, he combined them both. In the Dictionary of Places Mentioned in Sahih Al-Bukhari, Al-Harbi said: Abu Ishaq Al-Sukkari said: Asfan belongs to Banu Al-Mustaliq from Khuza'ah, and from Asfan to Batn Marr is twenty-three miles, and in Asfan there are many wells, and a mile from it a spring for the children of Ja'far bin Sulayman, and there is a pool at the end of Asfan, and Ghadir Al-Ashtat is two and a half miles from Asfan. And twelve miles from Asfan is a place called Wadi Al-Kara', with wells and the well of Al-Qaryatayn. And from Asfan to Janab Banu Sayfi is nineteen miles, and before that by a mile is Bir Dabi' and before it Bir Al-Qurashi. Yaqut said: Usfan with dammah on the first, sukun on the second, then fa', and ending with nun, fa'lan from 'asafa the desert, meaning he crosses it without guidance or intention, he said: It was named Usfan because of the torrent's deviation from it. Abu Mansur said: Usfan is a watering place on the road between Al-Juhfah and Mecca. And others said: Usfan is between the two mosques and it is two stages from Mecca, and it is said: Usfan is a comprehensive village with a pulpit, palm trees, and farms, thirty-six miles from Mecca, adjacent to Tihamah, and from Usfan to a place called Al-Sahil, and Al-Sahil is one night from Medina, which is Al-Ghuraf. And Al-Sukkari said: Usfan is two stages from Mecca on the road to Medina, and Al-Hafah is three stages. The Prophet, peace be upon him, raided Banu Lihyan at Usfan, five years, two months, and eleven days after his migration. And a Bedouin said: You have reminded me of the cooing of a dove in Usfan, my family in the heart is sad. Woe to you, how much you reminded me of our land today, perhaps my dove in Hijaz is. By Allah, I will not forget you as long as the east wind blows and as long as the arak stick is green in varieties. And Al-Bakri said: Asfan with dammah on the first and sukun on the second: A comprehensive village belonging to Banu Al-Mustaliq from Khuza'ah, with many wells and ponds. And Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, prayed the fear prayer between Asfan and Dajnan. And Jabir narrated that the Prophet, peace be upon him, was in Asfan and the polytheists were between them and the Qiblah, so he prayed the fear prayer with them. And Ata' narrated from Ibn Abbas: The environs of the Sacred Mosque are Asfan, Dajnan, and Marr Al-Zahran. And Mujahid narrated from Ibn Abbas: When the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, conquered Mecca, he fasted until he reached Asfan, then broke his fast. And Nafi' narrated from Ibn Umar that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, passed in Asfan by Wadi Al-Mujadhimin, so he quickened his walk. And Ibn Muqbil said in the killing of Uthman: Asfan except that every pass in Asfan is sheltered by a hunter at night. And Al-Waqidi said in the news of the expedition of Banu Lihyan: Narrated to me Abdul-Malik bin Wahb Abu Al-Hasan Al-Aslami from Ata' bin Abi Marwan: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, went out in the crescent of Rabi' Al-Awwal in the sixth year, reaching Gharran and Usfan, and was absent for fourteen. Narrated to me Ma'mar from Al-Zuhri from Ibn Ka'b bin Malik. And narrated to me Yahya bin Abdullah bin Abi Qatadah from Abdullah bin Abi Bakr bin Hazm and others, and one added to the other: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was greatly saddened by Asim bin Thabit and his companions, so he went out with two hundred men and twenty horses with his companions, and camped at the site of the dome from the direction of Al-Jurf, camping at the beginning of his day appearing to head towards part of the Levant, then he set out cooled, passing by Gharabat then by Bayn until he came out to Sukhayrat Al-Thumam, meeting the road there, then hastened the march until he reached Batn Gharran where their casualty was, prayed for mercy upon them and said: Congratulations to you on martyrdom. Banu Lihyan heard and fled to the mountain tops, so we could not catch any of them, he stayed a day or two and sent patrols in every direction, but they could not catch anyone, then he left until Usfan. And Arram said: Usfan is on the back of the road specifically for Khuza'ah. It has a pulpit, many palm trees and farms. And Atiq Al-Baladi described Asfan geographically: Asfan is an inhabited town located north of Mecca eighty kilometers on the pilgrimage road to Medina, at the meeting of Wadi Fidah with Wadi Al-Saghu, with ancient sweet wells plastered and guarded. And in Asfan there is an emirate center affiliated with Marr Al-Zahran, its inhabitants are from Banu Amr from Harb, and the center's head is Ibn Hamadi, emir of Bisha, and affiliated to it are Fidah, Al-Saghu, Shamiyah bin Hamadi, and Al-Ghula'. It is overlooked from all sides by black lava fields, and three roads exit from it: To Medina taking Thaniyat Ghazal to Khulays, to Mecca on Al-Saghu then Dajnan, and to Jeddah exiting south-west, and Asfan is an important transportation hub and a watering place for the Bedouins, its agriculture is little, and it is said that its water is abundant, and in the recent period the people dug a well whose water came out abundant and sweet, so its cultivation increased despite the narrowness of the land. I say: This is Asfan that is mentioned in the Sunnah and the biography, still existing by its name, known by it, inhabited by people, affiliated to the Emirate of Mecca.","Translation":"This story talks about Usfan town between Mecca and Medina, mentioned in Prophetic hadiths and Islamic biographies. The town distinguished by wells and farms, important transportation center in ancient period, still inhabited today."},{"Place":"Al-Aqaba","City":"Mecca the Honored","Description":"The throwing place of the great pebble at Mina. Al-Bukhari narrated with his chain from Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them: That Usamah bin Zaid was riding behind the Prophet, peace be upon him, from Arafah to Muzdalifah, then he rode Al-Fadl from Muzdalifah to Mina, he said: Both said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, continued to say talbiyah until he threw the pebble of Al-Aqaba. Yaqut said: Aqabah: With movement, it is the long mountain that blocks the road so one takes to it, and it is long and difficult to ascend the mountain. And Al-Aqaba where the Prophet, peace be upon him, was pledged allegiance in Mecca, Aqabah, and there is a mosque there, and from it the pebble of Al-Aqaba is thrown, and its story is that the Prophet, peace be upon him, in the beginning of his mission would attend the season at the market of Ukaz, the market of Al-Majaz, and Majannah, and follow the tribes in their encampments inviting them to protect him to convey the messages of his Lord, but he found no one to support him, until in the eleventh year of prophethood he met six men from Al-Aws at this Aqabah, so he invited them, peace be upon him, to Islam, and offered them to protect him, so they said: This is, by Allah, the prophet that the Jews promise us, they find him written in their Torah, so they believed in him and affirmed him. ... And they departed to Medina, and mentioned the matter of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, so people responded to them and Islam spread among them, then in the twelfth year of prophethood, twelve men came to the season from them, these six and six others. Then in the thirteenth year of prophethood, seventy men and two women came from them... So if you see from the Ansar someone called Badri, it is attributed to him having attended the Battle of Badr with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and if it is said Aqabi, it is attributed to pledging allegiance to the Prophet in this place. I say: This is some of what concerns Al-Aqaba of the great pebble in Mina, and since this place is still known by this name among all Muslims, and it is one of the sacred sites that Muslims visit every year, and these sites have been defined by Muslim scholars and described and elaborated upon in a way that this place does not allow, so I suffice with this amount of talk about it, and something of clarification has preceded in the entry of Al-Jamrah, so look at it. And many landmarks of this Aqabah and around it have changed due to the reforms carried out by the Third Saudi State from time to time, to facilitate throwing the pebbles and ease the passage of pilgrims around it. And Al-Aqaba is one of the common names by which more than one place is called, and Yaqut mentioned some of these places, saying: Al-Aqaba: On the road to Mecca after Waqisah and before Al-Qa' for those heading to Mecca, and it is water for Banu Akramah from Bakr bin Wa'il. Aqabat Al-Sayr: At the frontiers near Al-Hadath, a narrow long pass. And Al-Aqaba behind the river of Isa near the Tigris in Baghdad, a neighborhood attributed to a number of hadith scholars. And Aqabat Al-Rakab near Nahavand, Sayf said: When the Muslims headed to Nahavand and their mounts crowded in this pass, they called it Aqabat Al-Rakab.","Translation":"This story talks about Jamrat Al-Aqabah in Mina, throwing the great jamrah in Mina during Hajj.

Events developed over years until seventy men and two women in thirteenth year of prophethood. Aqabah jamrah great known to all Muslims, supervised by Muslim scholars describing in detail.

They said: We were blocked from the news of the heaven and meteors were sent upon us. Yaqut said: Okaz: With dammah on the first and ending with dha' mu'jamah. Al-Suhayli said: It was named Okaz because the Arabs used to gather there and some would boast over others, meaning rub. And 'akadha someone his opponent with arguments and proofs. And others said: 'Akadha the man his animal if he restrained it, and the people ta'akkadha if they restrained themselves looking into their affairs, he said: And thereby it was named Okaz. And Al-Suhayli reported: They used to boast in the market of Okaz when they gathered, and it is said: 'Akadha the man his companion if he boasted over him and overcame him in boasting, so it was named Okaz for that. And Okaz: Name of a market from the markets of the Arabs in the Jahiliyyah, and Arab tribes used to gather at Okaz every year and boast there, and their poets would attend and recite what they newly composed of poetry, then disperse. Al-Asma'i said: Okaz is palms in a valley one night from Taif, and three nights from Mecca, and there the Arab market was held in a place called Al-Athida', and there were the days of Al-Fijar, and there were rocks they circumambulated and pilgrimaged to. Al-Waqidi said: Okaz is between Nakhlah and Taif and Dhu Al-Majaz, behind Arafah and Majannah at Marr Al-Zahran, and these are the markets of Quraysh and the Arabs, and there was none greater than Okaz. They said: The Arabs used to stay at the market of Okaz in the month of Shawwal, then move to the market of Majannah and stay twenty days of Dhu Al-Qa'dah, then move to the market of Dhu Al-Majaz and stay the days of Hajj. I say: And the later ones wrote researches talking about the location of the market of Okaz in light of what the predecessors said, I present a summary of these researches in the small library, representing the eighteenth of them, it says: The narrations that tried to determine the location of the market of Okaz differed, but what the opinion of Mr. Rushdi Malhas and Ibn Bulayhid settled on in Okaz: That it was mobile on land extending from south of Ashirah to Al-Sayl Al-Saghir and Al-Hawiyah. And Hamad Al-Jasir wrote an extensive research on the place of the market of Okaz, mentioning in the research the sayings of the predecessors and the later ones, and cited what is related from Al-Rada'i's poem with the names and places he described in his path to Okaz, and said: The opinions summarize that the location of Okaz is in the highest of Najd and not in Tihamah, nor in Hijaz nor in Yemen, therefore Ibn Khurdadhbah counted it in his book (Al-Masalik), Ibn Rustah in (Al-A'laq Al-Nafisah), and Al-Bakri in (Mu'jam Ma Ista'jam) from the districts of Mecca in Najd. And he said: All the preceding descriptions apply perfectly to the vast land east of Taif with a tilt north outside the chain of mountains surrounding it, and that land is about 35 kilometers away from Taif approximately, bounded on the west by the mountains of Banu Adwan Al-Aqrab, Shurb Al-Ubayla' - and on the east by the desert of Rakbah, and on the north by the edge of Rakbah and the mountains located east of Wadi Qarran, and this land includes Wadi Al-Akhidar, which was known anciently as Wadi Okaz, and Wadi Shurb when they overflow into the desert, and exit from the mountains and what is between them of land and what connects to them from the edge of Rakbah. However, Ali Hafiz said: And I believe that Okaz was mobile in these vast lands that the two determinations include, as Professor Malhas and Ibn Bulayhid investigated. I say: This is some of what the historians mentioned from the many sayings in determining the location of the market of Okaz, and this market is one of the markets held in the Jahiliyyah, where poetry and speeches are displayed, boasting appears, wines are drunk, and often tribal fanaticisms compete there, Jahili prides appear, and end in wars. So when Islam came, it abolished these markets, and abolished what was held in them of Jahili manifestations, so their traces were erased, their landmarks disappeared, and researchers differed in determining their locations without reaching agreement in what they said.","Translation":"This story talks about Ukaz market, place northeast Taif witnessed Arabs' gathering in Jahiliyyah for trade and boasting.

Ibn Hajar said: Quba is pronounced with a damma on the Qaf, then a Ba' extended according to most linguists, and Al-Bakri denied shortening it, but the author of Al-Ayn narrated it. Al-Bakri said: Among the Arabs, some mention it and decline it, while others feminize it and do not decline it. In Al-Matali', it is three miles from the city, and Yaqut said two miles to the left of those heading to Mecca, and it is from the highlands of Al-Madinah, named after a well there. Al-Maraghi said, and Ibn Al-Najjar narrated through his chain to Uwaim bin Sa'ida that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to the people of Quba: God has praised you well in His noble book: (In it are men who love to purify themselves) from Surah At-Tawbah, verse 108. Al-Maraghi also said: The mosque of Quba remained as built by the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, until Umar bin Abdul Aziz, may God have mercy on him, rebuilt it when building the mosque of Al-Madinah in the state it is in today. It then deteriorated over time and was demolished, so it was renewed in the year 555 AH by the minister Jamal Al-Din Muhammad bin Ali bin Abi Al-Mansur Al-Isfahani, known as Al-Jawad. The correct distance is that Quba is three miles from Al-Madinah, Al-Baji said two miles, and Qadi Iyad said Bani Amr bin Awf is on two-thirds of a farsakh. Ibn Al-Najjar said: I measured the mosque of Quba, its length is sixty-eight cubits slightly less, width the same, height twenty, and the minaret's length from the roof to its top is twenty-two, the minaret is to the right of the prayer area, and it is square, and God knows best. Al-Matri said: The mosque of Quba is in Bani Amr bin Awf, and it was a barn for Kulthum bin Al-Hidm, so the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, gave it to him and built it as a mosque, founded it, and prayed in it before arriving in Al-Madinah. The mosque remained as built by the Messenger of God until Umar bin Abdul Aziz rebuilt it... It deteriorated over time and was demolished, so the minister Jamal Al-Din Muhammad bin Abi Mansur Al-Isfahani, minister of Bani Zanki, renewed it... and that was in the year 555 AH. Quba is three miles from Al-Madinah, Al-Baji said two miles, Qadi Iyad said Bani Amr bin Awf on two-thirds of a farsakh, and the correct is the first, narrated from Malik, may God have mercy on him. Yaqut said: Quba with damma, originally the name of a well there, by which the village is known, homes of Bani Amr bin Awf from the Ansar, its Alif is Waw, extended or shortened, declined or not. Al-Qali only mentioned extension, Al-Khalil said it is shortened. Yaqut said: Whoever shortens it makes it plural of Qubwah with damma, and plural in the language of the people of Al-Madinah. Abu Hanifah said in the derivation of Quba: It is taken from Qabw, which is gathering and collecting, but he did not mention if it is plural or singular. It is a village two miles from Al-Madinah to the left of those heading to Mecca, with many building traces, and there is the Mosque of Taqwa, prosperous, in front a pavement and nice space, sweet wells and waters, and there is the Mosque of Harm, which the common people volunteer to demolish, as Al-Bashari said, and he mentioned many virtues of the mosque of Quba, and numbered those attributed to it from scholars and hadith narrators. Al-Sari bin Abdul Rahman bin Utbah bin Uwaymir bin Sa'ida Al-Ansari said: And it has a square in Barqah Khakh and a summer house in Al-Qasr, the palace of Quba. Bury me if I die in the armor of Arwa, and wash me with water from the well of Urwah, hot in winter, cold in summer, a lamp in the dark night. I say: The early historians have extensively mentioned Quba, its location, the virtues of its mosque, and elaborated in their narrations describing that. Since Quba is a known district from the highlands of Al-Madinah by this name anciently and in this era, and its mosque has continued to be inhabited since the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him, with prayer not interrupted until this era, I suffice with what the predecessors said as mentioned above. Likewise, later historians have spoken about Quba and its mosque, elaborating much on that, and I will mention here some of what they said. Abdul Quddus Al-Ansari said: The mosque of Quba is located in the southwest of the city, square in shape, side 40 meters, number of columns 29, with a mihrab and an antique marble minbar, which Al-Ashraf Qaitbay gifted to the Prophetic Mosque to place in the spot of the burned minbar, in the year 888 AH. After Sultan Murad the Ottoman sent the current minbar to the Prophetic Mosque, this minbar was moved to the mosque of Quba. The mosque of Quba has a minaret, and a pebbled courtyard with a dome said to contain the resting place of the Prophet's camel, peace be upon him, and in the courtyard a well. On the southern wall of the mosque in its east is a mihrab called (Taqat Al-Kashf), and the author of Mir'at Al-Haramayn says: I do not know what it reveals. Among the notable relics of this mosque is this stone inscribed with ancient Kufic script, speaking of the mosque's construction by one of the nobles in 435 AH, as if it was moved during some repairs from its door to this mihrab and installed there. The covered part of the mosque has domes, six arcades, and in the two rear arcades a room for storing belongings and carpets. It has external buttresses on its south, north, and east to strengthen its walls from these sides due to the lower adjacent ground. It is about 40 minutes' moderate walk from Bab Quba. Then Abdul Quddus Al-Ansari spoke about the construction of this mosque and the roads leading to it from the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to this era, ending with its construction in 1388 AH during the reign of King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, may God reward him. This is a summary of what Abdul Quddus Al-Ansari mentioned in his book Athar Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah. Al-Shanqiti said: The mosque of Quba was three miles from the Prophetic Mosque, but urban expansion connected it to the city, and Quba became a neighborhood in the midst of the city's buildings. Buildings have spread to its south and west amazingly, and to its west was the garden with Bir Aris, where the Prophet's ring, peace be upon him, fell from Uthman's hand, may God be pleased with him. I witnessed this well with water and a shaded arbor, then its place and the surrounding palms turned into a spacious parking lot. In the era of King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz, he ordered a massive expansion of the mosque of Quba at his personal expense, from the northern side, and work is ongoing rapidly now, I mean in Ramadan 1405 AH. I say: This is some of what Al-Shanqiti mentioned about the mosque of Quba.\"], [\"Quba\", \"Harrah Kashb\", \"Quba like the previous — and the common people pronounce it with sukun on the Qaf preceded by a kasra hamza, and shortened: an old sweet water place located in the eastern part of Harrah Kashb, a famous abundant water source that the old Iraqi Hajj road passes by.

Al-Hijri said: Leaving Dariyah heading to Mecca, drinks at Al-Jadilah, then Falhah, then Al-Dathina, then Quba, then Maran, then Wajrah, then Dhat Irq, then Al-Bustan, then Mecca. Notice that in Al-Hijri's phrase it is extended. As for Al-Bakri, he mentioned it extended and denied those who mentioned it shortened, saying: Quba with damma on the first, extended, on the pattern of fi'al, among the Arabs some mention it and decline it, others feminize it and do not decline it, and there are two places: a place on the road to Mecca from Basra, and another Quba in Al-Madinah. Ibn Al-Zubayri said in declining it: When she rubbed at Quba her camel's chest, and killing intensified among Abd Al-Ashal. Al-Isfahani said in mentioning the stages of the Hajj road: Arrives at Al-Dathina, a village on the road from Basra to Mecca, then arrives at a plain called Qa' Al-Janub, then arrives at Quba, then Maran, a water and large prosperous village with palms. Al-Hamdani said: Quba has wells, palms, and ruins, belonging to Amir bin Rabi'ah, and Maran has palms, wells, and a fortress, between Quba and Al-Shubaykah leaning in the Harrah. Al-Harbi said: Ibn Abi Sa'd informed me from Al-Nawfali from his father, said: Quba in the Harrah, from Al-Dathina to Quba twenty-seven miles, and in Quba shallow wells with much water, and eight miles from Quba a dinner place called Balad, with sweet wells, then Maran. From the poem of Wahb bin Jarir on the stops of Iraqi Hajj, mentioned by Al-Harbi: Until it passed Al-Dathina, and they weakened, they were exhausted, complaining of blisters and they blistered, did not stop and proceeded in the evening, we lead fine fresh ones, arrived before noon at Quba, the people descended there hastily, they prepared and unloaded the camels, watered without setting down the saddles, then proceeded ascending in the harsh Harrah, determined for the goal and the path, hurrying running towards its aim happily, not tiring between scattered hardships, and when stirred like a jerboa, descends when dropping like a planet, so morning before sunrise at Maran, between weak-rooted thickets, traversing the desert expanses with riders. I say: Quba is still known by this name, and I have exhausted the discussion about it in my book (Dictionary of Upper Najd) under its entry, so refer to it.","Translation":"Quba is a known suburb in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, spelled with a Qaf that has a damma, followed by a Ba' with one dot, and ending with an extended Alif.

Al-Hijri said: Leaving Dariyah heading to Mecca, drinks at Al-Jadilah, then Falhah, then Al-Dathina, then Quba, then Maran, then Wajrah, then Dhat Irq, then Al-Bustan, then Mecca. Notice that in Al-Hijri's phrase it is extended. As for Al-Bakri, he mentioned it extended and denied those who mentioned it shortened, saying: Quba with damma on the first, extended, on the pattern of fi'al, among the Arabs some mention it and decline it, others feminize it and do not decline it, and there are two places: a place on the road to Mecca from Basra, and another Quba in Al-Madinah. Ibn Al-Zubayri said in declining it: When she rubbed at Quba her camel's chest, and killing intensified among Abd Al-Ashal. Al-Isfahani said in mentioning the stages of the Hajj road: Arrives at Al-Dathina, a village on the road from Basra to Mecca, then arrives at a plain called Qa' Al-Janub, then arrives at Quba, then Maran, a water and large prosperous village with palms. Al-Hamdani said: Quba has wells, palms, and ruins, belonging to Amir bin Rabi'ah, and Maran has palms, wells, and a fortress, between Quba and Al-Shubaykah leaning in the Harrah. Al-Harbi said: Ibn Abi Sa'd informed me from Al-Nawfali from his father, said: Quba in the Harrah, from Al-Dathina to Quba twenty-seven miles, and in Quba shallow wells with much water, and eight miles from Quba a dinner place called Balad, with sweet wells, then Maran. From the poem of Wahb bin Jarir on the stops of Iraqi Hajj, mentioned by Al-Harbi: Until it passed Al-Dathina, and they weakened, they were exhausted, complaining of blisters and they blistered, did not stop and proceeded in the evening, we lead fine fresh ones, arrived before noon at Quba, the people descended there hastily, they prepared and unloaded the camels, watered without setting down the saddles, then proceeded ascending in the harsh Harrah, determined for the goal and the path, hurrying running towards its aim happily, not tiring between scattered hardships, and when stirred like a jerboa, descends when dropping like a planet, so morning before sunrise at Maran, between weak-rooted thickets, traversing the desert expanses with riders. I say: Quba is still known by this name, and I have exhausted the discussion about it in my book (Dictionary of Upper Najd) under its entry, so refer to it."},{"Place":"Al-Qudum","City":"Syria lands","Description":"Al-Qudum is a village in Syria.

Covered different narrations on mountain name and possible meanings among scholars, but all agree located in Dawas area."},{"Place":"Qadid","City":"Mecca Al-Mukarramah (a mountain overlooking Mina)","Description":"A place on the road between Mecca and Medina, closer to Mecca. Bukhari narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas - in the story of the Conquest Battle - that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, fasted until he reached Al-Kadid, the water between Qadid and Usfan, then he broke his fast, and continued breaking it until the month ended. In a narration by Bukhari from Sufyan - Sufyan said: Manat at Al-Mushallal from Qadid. Al-Waqidi said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, sent Ghalib bin Abdullah Al-Laithi, one of Bani Kalb bin Awf, in a expedition I was in, and ordered him to raid Bani Al-Mulawah at Al-Kadid, who are from Bani Laith. We went out until we were at Qadid, where we met Al-Harith bin Malik bin Al-Barsa, so we captured him, and he said: I only came seeking Islam. Yaqut said: Qadid is the diminutive of qad from saying they qadd the skin, or from qad with kasra, which is the qad of the young goat, or it could be the diminutive of al-qadd from the verse: (ways in portions) Surah Al-Jinn verse 11, which are the groups. Kathir was asked why it was named Qadid, he thought for a while then said: Its flood went in portions. Qadid is a place near Mecca. Ibn Al-Kalbi said: When Tubba returned from Medina after his war with its people, he camped at Qadid, a wind blew tearing the tents of his companions, so it was named Qadid. Abdullah bin Qais Al-Ruqayat said: Tell Fand to follow the caravans, perhaps our life will be pleasant and sufficient for us, departures in the evening from Qadid, arrivals with the forenoon at Usfan. Yaqut mentioned a number of scholars and hadith narrators attributed to Qadid. Al-Bakri said: Qadid with damma on the first, in the form of diminutive, a comprehensive village with many waters and gardens... Between Qadid and Al-Kadid sixteen miles, Al-Kadid closer to Mecca, named Qadid for the splitting of floods there, and it belongs to Khuzaymah. At Qadid was the battle of the Kharijite called Talib Al-Haqq with the people of Medina, so a woman from Medina lamented them: Oh our woe and alas, Qadid annihilated my men. Al-Mushallal from Qadid, and at Al-Mushallal was Manat which they worshiped. Malik said it was opposite Qadid, and the Ansar before Islam would ihlal for Manat the tyrant. Ibn Saad narrated on the authority of Jundab bin Makith Al-Juhani: The Messenger of God sent Ghalib bin Abdullah Al-Laithi, then one of Bani Kalb bin Awf, in an expedition, wrote for them and ordered them to raid Bani Al-Mulawah at Al-Kadid, from Bani Laith. We went out until at Qadid we met Al-Harith bin Al-Barsa Al-Laithi, so we captured him. Ibn Saad in the story of the Conquest Battle: He went out on Wednesday for ten nights passed from Ramadan after Asr - meaning the Messenger of God - then marched, when at Qadid he tied the banners and standards and gave them to the tribes, then camped at Marr Al-Zahran in the evening. Ibn Saad in the biography of Al-Qasim bin Muhammad: Yazid bin Harun said from Umar bin Husayn: I witnessed the death of Al-Qasim, he died at Qadid, buried at Al-Mushallal, between them about three miles. Al-Harbi said: Kathir Azza said it was named Qadid for the splitting of floods there. Abu Ishaq Al-Bakri said it belongs to Khuzaymah... From Qadid to Usfan twenty-three miles, from Qadid to Khalis Ayn Ibn Bazee eight miles. At Qadid many wells, a pond, and a mile from the village four wells lined with wood, a mile and half from the village a spring known as Al-Awbar that dried up, behind Qadid more than two miles Wadi Ghazal. Al-Aqabah before Khalis three miles, a pass at Luqaf, near it the Prophet's mosque. This is some of what the predecessors mentioned in defining and describing Qadid, this place is famous in books of biography and campaigns, still exists with its name unchanged. From the sayings of the later: Atiq Al-Biladi said: Qadid: a large valley from the valleys of Hijaz, fertile with many springs and farms, 25 springs some dried up, its upper waters from Harrah Dhara, part of the great Harrah of Hijaz at its southern end, Harrah Waqim at its northern end. Then descends west between Wadi Al-Akhram south, and Dawran north, both shorter than it, its upper part called Sitarah, until reaching Al-Bahul, the main market of Qadid, then the valley named Qadid until it flows into the Red Sea at Al-Qudaymah town, length about 150 km, half Sitarah half Qadid, inhabitants of Sitarah Bani Sulaym, of Qadid Zubaida from Harb, border between them Al-Dhabiyah, large tributaries like Nakhb, Taba, Al-Falaq, Hawrah, Hamluq, Dhafar, Marakh, Tadimri, Talhah, all flow into Sitarah. Qadid bordered north by Al-Qadidiyah harrah attributed to the valley, was named Al-Mushallal, Qadid flood passes 130 km north of Mecca, the road crosses there. Hamd Al-Jasir erred saying it is a weak village between Khalis and Usfan, the error: 1- Qadid not a village but great valley with over forty villages. 2- Not between Khalis and Usfan but north of Khalis, Khalis north of Usfan, so between Khalis and Rabigh. Since the place retained its name over centuries, and still known, I suffice with this amount of talk about it.","Translation":"This story talks about Qadid, place on road between Mecca and Medina, closer to Mecca. In conquest expedition time, the Messenger fasted until reaching Al-Kadid, water between Qadid and Usfan, where broke fast not fasting until month ended, peace be upon him."},{"Place":"Qarn Al-Thaalib","City":"Mecca Al-Mukarramah","Description":"A small mountain overlooking Mina. Bukhari narrated on the authority of Aisha, wife of the Prophet, that she said to the Prophet: Has a day come upon you harder than Uhud? He said: I met from your people what I met, the hardest was the day of Al-Aqabah when I offered myself to Ibn Abd Yalil bin Abd Kulal, he did not respond, so I left grieved on my face, did not recover until at Qarn Al-Thaalib. Ibn Hajar said: Qarn Al-Thaalib is the miqat of Najd people, also called Qarn Al-Manazil, a day and night from Mecca, qarn every small mountain detached from a large mountain. Iyadh narrated some narrators with fatha on ra, said it's mistake, Al-Qabisi narrated who sukun ra meant the mountain, who moved it meant the road near it. Al-Azraqi in mentioning distance from Mina mosque to Al-Muhassir: from Mina mosque to Qarn Al-Thaalib one thousand five hundred thirty cubits. In mentioning miles from Haram mosque to Imam's position at Arafah: fourth mile position below third Jamrah near Khayf mosque fifteen cubits, fifth mile behind Qarn Al-Thaalib hundred cubits, sixth mile in wall of Muhassir. Al-Fakihi: Qarn Al-Thaalib mountain overlooking lower Mina, between it and Mina mosque thousand five hundred cubits, named for many foxes sheltering there. Ibn Saad: Al-Fadl bin Dukayn narrated from Hafs from Jaafar from his father that Ali bin Husayn walked to Jamrat, had house in Mina, people of Sham harmed him so moved to Qarn Al-Thaalib or near, rode to house then walked to Jamrat. Yaqut: Judge Iyadh said: Qarn Al-Manazil and Qarn Al-Thaalib, with sukun ra: miqat of Najd people opposite Mecca a day and night, also qarn without addition, origin small elongated mountain detached from large, some narrated with fatha on ra mistake, qarn a tribe from Yemen. Al-Bakri: Qarn Al-Thaalib plural tha'lab: place opposite Mecca, Nasib said: Our neighbor in Hajj days you and us camped at Qarn Al-Thaalib. From above two things clear: one: who said Qarn Al-Thaalib is Qarn Al-Manazil miqat of Najd erred, confused two places. Second: Qarn Al-Thaalib small mountain in lower Mina, some mentioned diminutive, its location in Mina distances no doubt it's in Mina, home of Ali bin Al-Husayn in Mina during Mina days. In Nasib's poetry indicates Qarn Al-Thaalib was a camp for pilgrims in Mina. Atiq Al-Biladi: Qarn Al-Thaalib was in Mina, small hill then removed. This hill removed due to Saudi state reforms expanding roads and homes in Mina for pilgrims comfort. In drawing Qarn Al-Manazil more clarification, see it.","Translation":"This story talks about \"Qarn Al-Tha'alib\" mountain at lower Mina, Najd people's miqat.

He said: Messenger of God set for Najd people Qarn, for Medina people Dhu Al-Hulayfah, for Sham people Al-Juhfah. Also narrated from Ibn Abbas: Prophet set for Medina people Dhu Al-Hulayfah, for Sham Al-Juhfah, for Najd Qarn Al-Manazil, for Yemen Yalamlam. Ibn Hajar: Al-Manazil plural of manzil, compound additive name of place, called Qarn without addition, with fatha qaf sukun ra then nun, Sahhah owner set with fatha ra erred, Nawawi agreed on error. Iyadh from Qabisi: who said with sukun meant mountain, with fatha meant road, mountain two stages from Mecca east. Al-Fakihi: Qarn Al-Manazil one times set by Messenger, said Messenger ihram from it when came from Taif for umrah. Al-Rada'i in poem: Until caravan approached Medani with power of benefactor not weakness replaced fear with safety house came miqats Wadi Qarn and mosque with beauty there ihlal hajj before corner and Mash'arun badan people badan drive away marfath so not betray.

From Qabisi comment: who said qarn with sukun meant overlooking mountain at place, with fatha meant road branching different roads.

What Yaqut نقل from Asma'i: mountain overlooking Arafah this mountain small overlooking Arafah stand pilgrims Arafah day, now called Al-Qarin diminutive qarn, also Jabal Al-Rahmah. What نقل from Judge Iyadh: Qarn Al-Manazil and Qarn Al-Thaalib confusion between two distant places, preceded clarification in drawing (Qarn Al-Thaalib), scholars agreed defining Qarn Al-Manazil between Mecca and Taif mentioning distance between each, agreed it's miqat Najd Taif Yemen people - meaning Yemen people coming via Taif - this place ihram Najd people became Al-Sayl Al-Kabir, known also old name. Atiq Al-Biladi described this place comprehensively geographically: Al-Sayl Al-Kabir: sayl valley water town between two palms Shamiyah Yamanayah in elevated hizm, but its building extends in Qarn Al-Manazil from Nakhlah Shamiyah, its water from it, road Taif to Mecca passing Nakhlah Yamanayah called Yamanayah road, eighty km east Mecca, fifty-three km northwest Taif, was known Qarn Al-Manazil, miqat Najd and who pass it others, name Qarn today on valley upper to Al-Muharram on Taif road passing Al-Hada' valley Qarn, town Al-Sayl Al-Kabir distinguish from Al-Sayl Al-Saghir, named Sayl because its valley water flowed on earth surface, today primary school two mosques one Friday prayer, authority enjoining good, in bend Nakhlah Shamiyah overlooking town east late agriculture mostly palms, inhabitants settled from Utaybah, land bare elevated hizm above surroundings, air pure.

Al-Bukhari narrated through his chain from Ibn Buhaynah, may God be pleased with him: The Prophet, peace be upon him, had cupping while in ihram at Lahy Jamal in the middle of his head. Ibn Hajar said: Lahy Jamal: with fatha on the Lam, and some narrated kasra and sukun on the plain Ha', and fatha on Jim and Mim, a place on the road to Mecca. Al-Bakri mentioned in his dictionary — under Al-Aqiq — he said it is the well of Jamal mentioned in the hadith of Abu Jahm on tayammum. Others said it is the pass of Al-Juhfah seven miles from As-Suwaya, and in Abu Dharr's narration it is Lahya Jamal in dual form, and for others in singular. It is a mistake to think it is the jaws of the known animal camel, and that it was the cupping tool, and Al-Hazimi and others asserted that it was during the Farewell Hajj. Al-Majd said: Lahya Jamal with fatha then sukun, dual of Lahy, which are the two bones containing the teeth in every jawed creature, and Jamal with Jim: the camel. In the hadith: The Prophet, peace be upon him, had cupping at Lahy Jamal, which is a pass seven miles from As-Suwaya, and in Muslim's book it is a water, and it is narrated as Lahy Jamal in singular, and narrated with kasra on Lam and fatha, and fatha is more famous. Al-Harbi said: And behind Abdah three and a half miles to the left of the road are the hills of Abdah, on some of them two isolated rocks not held by anything, unchanged, one called Jamal and the other Jamila, then Lahy Jamal six miles from Al-Akharjah, and between them two wells and Bedouin houses, and from Lahy Jamal to Burayd Armam five and a half miles. Hamad Al-Jasir commented on it saying: Lahya Jamal: a mountain on the road to Fayd six miles from Al-Akharjah, Al-Asadi said: Named so because they spread and extended and their meeting point approached, so likened to the two jaws. In Nasr's book: Lahy Jamal a place between Al-Madinah and Fayd on a path other than the main one, between it and Fayd 30 miles. Al-Harbi said in another place: From At-Talub to As-Suwaya six miles, and there a well three cubits deep with thick water, and a mile from At-Talub is the mosque of the Prophet, peace be upon him, between Lahy Jamal. Narrated through his chain from Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, had cupping at Lahy Jamal, and it is said As-Suwaya about a mile from Wadi Al-Ababid attributed to Al-Qahah for Bani Ghifar. Narrated through his chain from Sufyan that the Prophet, peace be upon him, had cupping at Al-Qahah. Hamad Al-Jasir commented in his footnote and cited a text from a source marked B, and said: It is good to cite it fully, so he said: Seven miles from As-Suwaya is Bir At-Talub, an ancient well, where Muawiyah looked into it and was afflicted with a disease, so he hurried to Mecca, and Nadlah bin Amr Al-Ghifari used to dwell at Bir At-Talub, and following At-Talub is Lahy Al-Jamal, a water where the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, had cupping in the middle of his head while in ihram, and in a narration while fasting, and in another while fasting and in ihram. Al-Bukhari narrated: Muhammad bin Sawa' said: Hisham informed us from Ikrimah from Ibn Abbas that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, had cupping at Lahy Jamal while in ihram, on the middle of his head due to a migraine he had, and dwelling at Lahy Jamal was Abdullah bin Arqam Al-Balawi from the companions of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. And it is said As-Suwaya near a mile from its well is Wadi Al-Ubabid and it is Al-Qahah. I say: What preceded from the sayings of the scholars indicates that Al-Hay Jamal is a name for two places; one of them is hills located on the Iraqi Hajj road that passes through the town of Fayd, the known town in the southeast of the city of Hail.

Al-Bukhari narrated from Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) that when the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) arrived in Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal fell ill. Abu Bakr, when overcome by fever, would say: 'Every man wakes among his family, yet death is nearer than the strap of his sandal.' Bilal, when his fever subsided, would recite: 'Would that I knew if I shall spend a night in a valley surrounded by idhkhir and jalil, and will I ever drink the waters of Majannah, and will Shamah and Tufail appear to me?' Yāqūt said Majannah, with a fatha on the first letter and a doubled nūn, was a market of the Arabs in the pre-Islamic era, alongside Dhū al-Majāz and ʿUkāẓ. Al-Aṣmaʿī stated that Majannah was in Marr al-Ẓahrān near a mountain called Al-Aṣfar, about a postal stage from Mecca. It was held for ten days at the end of Dhu al-Qa'dah, following the market of ʿUkāẓ and preceding Dhū al-Majāz for eight days in Dhu al-Ḥijjah, before heading to ʿArafah on the Day of Tarwiyah. Al-Dāwūdī said Majannah was near ʿArafah, while Al-Aṣmaʿī noted it was associated with Banū al-Duʾil in Tihāmah near Tufail, referenced by Bilal in his poetry. Al-Bakrī described Majannah as a place a few miles from Mecca in Marr al-Ẓahrān. Abu al-Fatḥ suggested the name Majannah might derive from gardens (jannāt) or from 'majana' (to act recklessly), though the exact reason is uncertain. Others stated Majannah, associated with Kinānah, had Shamah and Tufail as overlooking mountains and was abandoned over time in favor of markets in Mecca, Mina, and ʿArafah. Abu ʿUbaydah and others linked Majannah to Marr al-Ẓahrān near Al-Aṣfar. ʿĀtiq al-Bilādī argued Majannah is modern-day Baḥrah, between Jeddah and Mecca, citing its location below Marr al-Ẓahrān, its association with Kinānah, the presence of Al-Aṣfar mountain, and local traditions identifying the area below Wadi al-Shuʿbah as Majannah. He noted Baḥrah’s suitability as a market due to its firm ground, abundant water, and proximity to tribes like Hudhayl and Khuzāʿah, with its water renowned for sweetness, possibly why Bilal longed for it.","Translation":"This story discusses Majannah, an ancient Arab market held in the last ten days of Dhu al-Qa'dah near Mecca.

Scholars differ on Majannah’s exact location, but the prevailing view, supported by Al-Aṣmaʿī and Abu ʿUbaydah, places it in Marr al-Ẓahrān near Al-Aṣfar mountain, likely in the area known today as Wadi Fatimah. ʿĀtiq al-Bilādī argued that Majannah is modern-day Baḥrah, between Mecca and Jeddah, supported by geographical and historical evidence."},{"Place":"Majma' Al-Bahrayn","City":"Qazwin, Iran","Description":"Al-Bahrayn is the dual of bahr (sea), added to it is a place where scholars differ in identifying. Allah Almighty said: (And [mention] when Moses said to his servant, 'I will not cease [traveling] until I reach the junction of the two seas or continue for a long period.') Surah Al-Kahf, verse 60. Al-Bukhari narrated on the authority of Ubayy ibn Ka'b from the Prophet, peace be upon him, who said: Moses the Prophet, peace be upon him, stood addressing the Children of Israel and was asked, 'Who is the most knowledgeable person?' He said, 'I am.' So Allah reproached him for not attributing knowledge to Him. Allah revealed to him: 'A servant of Mine at the junction of the two seas is more knowledgeable than you.' Ibn Kathir said: Qatadah and others said they are the Persian Sea to the east and the Roman Sea to the west. Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Qurazi said: Majma' al-Bahrayn is at Tangier, meaning the far west. Al-Qurtubi said: (The junction of the two seas) meaning their meeting place. Qatadah said: the Persian and Roman seas. Mujahid said... Ibn 'Atiyyah said: It is an arm extending from the surrounding ocean from north to south of the land of Persia beyond Azerbaijan, so the corner where the two seas meet near the land of Sham is Majma' al-Bahrayn according to this view. Al-Suddi said: The Kura and Aras in Armenia. Some scholars said: It is the sea of Andalusia from the surrounding ocean, as narrated by al-Naqqash, and this is often mentioned. A group said: It is Moses and al-Khidr, but this is a weak opinion. Narrated from Ibn Abbas but not authentic. The matter from the hadiths is that it was designated for him as a sea... Ibn Jarir said: It is said that by His saying (junction of the two seas) is meant the meeting of the Persian and Roman seas, and majma' is a verbal noun from 'jama'a yajma'u.' He narrated from Qatadah: (until I reach the junction of the two seas) and the two seas are the Persian Sea and the Roman Sea. The Roman Sea is to the west, the Persian to the east. From Mujahid: (junction of the two seas) the Roman and Persian seas, one to the east, the other to the west. From Muhammad ibn Ka'b: (I will not cease until I reach the junction of the two seas) Tangier. Ibn Sa'di said: (I will not cease until I reach the junction of the two seas) meaning I will continue traveling even if the hardship is long and fatigue overtakes me until I reach the junction of the two seas, the place where Allah revealed to him that you will find a servant of Allah's knowledgeable ones, with knowledge you do not have, or I will go for ages, meaning a long distance. The meaning: longing and desire prompted Moses to say this to his servant, and this is a firm resolve from him, so he proceeded. (But when they reached the junction between them, they forgot their fish) Surah Al-Kahf, verse 61. They had a fish with them for provision to eat, and it was promised that when the fish is lost, there is the servant you seek. So the fish took its way into the sea as in a tunnel, and this is one of the signs. The exegetes said: That fish they were provisioning from, when they reached that place, was touched by the wetness of the sea and slipped away by Allah's permission into the sea and became alive among its creatures. When Moses and his servant passed the junction of the two seas, Moses said to his servant: (Bring us our morning meal. We have certainly suffered in this, our journey, exhaustion) meaning: We have tired from this exceeding travel only, otherwise the long journey they reached to the junction of the two seas they did not find fatigue in it, and this is from the signs and indications for Moses of the presence of his quest. I say: What the exegetes said in determining the location of Majma' al-Bahrayn has great disagreement among them, but some opinions point to Majma' al-Bahrayn being the meeting of the Kura River and Aras River in Armenia, as said by al-Suddi, and Ibn 'Atiyyah said it is beyond Azerbaijan, and the meeting of Aras and Kura is beyond Azerbaijan between it and Armenia, and this is what historians inclined to. Ibn al-Faqih said: The border of Azerbaijan to Aras and Kura in Armenia, and the outlet of Aras from Qaliqala, passes through Arran where the Arran River flows into it, then passes through Warthan, and passes through the junction where it meets Kura, and between them is the city of Baylaqan, and they both flow into the Caspian Sea. Sheikh al-Rabwah said: The city of Armiyah, where the wall that Moses bin 'Imran built with the righteous servant in his company, and the city of Muqan called Mughan where our prophet Moses forgot the fish at the Caspian Sea, said to be built by Muqan bin Kashih bin Yafith bin Noah. Ibn Khurdadhbah said: In the stories of Moses, peace be upon him: (Did you see when we took refuge at the rock? Indeed, I forgot [there] the fish) Surah Al-Kahf, verse 63. The rock: rock of Shirwan, the sea: sea of Gilan, the village: village of Bajrawan. (Until when they met a boy) Surah Al-Kahf, verse 74, in the village of Khayran. The tribute of Armenia is four thousand dirhams. He said: The outlet of Aras river of Armenia from Qaliqala, passes through Arran and the Arran river flows into it, then passes through Warthan until it reaches the meeting place, which is Majma' al-Bahrayn that Allah mentioned, exalted be He, so it meets Kura and between them Baylaqan, when they meet they flow until they pour into the Caspian Sea. Yaqut said: Aras is a valley of Azerbaijan, the border of Azerbaijan is beyond Aras, outlet of Aras from Qaliqala, passes through Arran then Warthan then the junction which is Kura, between them Baylaqan, and Kura and Aras flow together into the Caspian Sea. I say: This is what historians said in determining the location of Majma' al-Bahrayn where Moses met al-Khidr, peace be upon him, but we do not find agreement among scholars on determining this place, though the geographical situation of the Aras and Kura rivers and their confluence and outflow into the Caspian Sea (Qazvin) almost suggests that this place is intended by the noble verse. It is understood from the implication of the noble verse (until I reach the junction of the two seas or continue for a long period) Surah Al-Kahf, verse 60, that the journey of Moses, peace be upon him, and his servant was a long journey distant from the lands from which the journey started, and it was a arduous journey. This supports the saying of some scholars that Majma' al-Bahrayn was in the Qazvin region, and Allah knows best, and in the entry (Aras) there is more information about this place.","Translation":"This story speaks about the journey of Prophet Moses, peace be upon him, to Majma' al-Bahrayn to meet the knowledgeable servant al-Khidr. Scholars differed in identifying the location of Majma' al-Bahrayn between the Persian Sea and Roman Sea or the confluence of two rivers in Armenia and others. The journey was long and arduous, confirming that the site of Majma' al-Bahrayn may be Qazvin, and Allah knows best."},{"Place":"Al-Muhassab (Al-Hasbah)","City":"Mecca Al-Mukarramah","Description":"Al-Muhassab (Al-Hasbah): Dhamma on mim, undotted ha open, stressed sad mahmalah, ending with ba'.

She said: Then I went out with him in the other group until he descended at Al-Muhassab and we descended with him.

Al-Bukhari narrated from Abdullah ibn Umar that the Prophet would camp in the stream at the bottom of Marr Az-Zahran before Madinah when descending from As-Safrawat, camping in the belly of that stream to the left of the road as you go to Makkah, between the Prophet's camp and the road only a stone's throw. Ibn Hajar said: Marr Az-Zahran with fath meem and tashdid raa and fath zaa majma and sukun haa, the valley called by the common people Batn Marr with sukun raa then Batn Marw with sukun raa ending with waw. Al-Bakri said: Between it and Makkah sixteen miles, and Abu Ghassan said: Named so because in the valley's belly a white vein from the ground spelling Marr, the meem separate from the raa, or for the bitterness of its water. Yaqut said: Marr with fath then tashdid, and Marr and Al-Mammar and Al-Marir the rope twisted tightly, and Ibn Al-A'rabi recited: Then we tightened its separation with Marr. And perhaps transferred from the verb Marr Yamurr then made a name, and Abdurrahman As-Suhayli mentioned something strange in its derivation: Named Marr because in it a vein from the valley unlike the land's color like a rounded meem followed by a differing raa, and mentioned from Kathir that he said: Named Marr for its bitterness, and I don't know the authenticity of this. And Marr Az-Zahran also called Marr Zahran a place one stage from Makkah mentioned in hadith. Arram said: From the village, and Az-Zahran is the valley, and in Marr many springs and palms and jamiz for Aslam and Hudhayl and Ghadira. Abu Sakhr Al-Hudhali said describing a cloud: And approached Marr to Majdal the driver of the chained walking leisurely meaning faced Marr. Al-Waqidi said: Between Marr and Makkah five miles, and said Khuzaymah named son of Haritha ibn Amr Muzayqiya ibn Amir Ma As-Sama ibn Al-Ghutrif from Al-Azd; because they separated from the children of Amr ibn Amir when they came from Ma'rib intending Sham and settled in Marr Az-Zahran stayed there, meaning cut off from them. Aunam ibn Ayub Al-Ansari Al-Khazraji in Islam said: When we descended Batn Marr Khuzaymah separated from us in the dwellings of Karakir protected every valley of Tihamah and protected with spear shafts and sharpened cutters our Khuzaymah people of effort and migration and our Ansar the army of the migrating Prophet and we proceeded until we settled in Yathrib without weakness from us nor discord and our caravan proceeded with a view on camel mounds and horse crowds intending the people of Sham until they became kings in the land of Sham above the pulpits those sons of Ma As-Sama inherited Damascus with rule one after another. Al-Bakri said: Marr Az-Zahran with fath awwal and tashdid thani added to Az-Zahran with open zaa majma, between Marr and the House sixteen miles, Umar ibn Al-Khattab returned the farewell tawaf of the House from Marr Az-Zahran. Sa'id ibn Al-Musayyib said: The dwellings of Akk were Marr Az-Zahran, and Kathir Azza said: Named Marr for its bitterness, and Abu Ghassan said: Named so because in the valley's belly Marr and palm writing with a white vein from the ground: spelling Marr, except the meem not connected to the raa. And the Prophet would camp in the stream at the bottom of Marr Az-Zahran when descending from As-Safrawat, camping in the belly of that stream to the left of the road as you go to Makkah, between the Prophet's camp and the road only a stone's throw, and there he camped during the treaty with Quraysh, and at Batn Marr Khuzaymah separated from their brothers so stayed in Makkah, and their brothers proceeded to Sham during the flood of Al-Arim. Hassan ibn Thabit said: When we descended Batn Marr Khuzaymah separated from us in the dwellings of Karakir. Al-Waqidi in the news of the conquest of Makkah and the Muslims gathered at Marr Az-Zahran, and no letter reached Quraysh from the Prophet's march to them, they grieved fearing the Prophet's raid, when the Prophet camped at Marr Az-Zahran in the evening he ordered his companions to light fires so they lit ten thousand fires, Quraysh agreed to send Abu Sufyan ibn Harb to scout news and said: If you meet Muhammad take security from him unless you see weakness from his companions then declare war. Al-Maraghi mentioned the mosques between Makkah and Madinah and said: And a mosque in the stream in Wadi Marr Az-Zahran, when descending from As-Safrawat a mosque in a valley to the left of the road as you go to Makkah and Marr Az-Zahran is Batn Marr the known, and the mosque is not known today. I say: The scholars differed in deriving the name Marr but did not differ in identifying it, and this valley became known as Wadi Fatimah a famous valley north of Makkah Al-Mukarramah. Atiq Al-Biladi described Wadi Marr Az-Zahran geographically: Marr Az-Zahran: A large valley from the largest valleys of Hijaz, its upper water catchments from the eastern slopes of the Sarawat west of Taif, and has two tributaries: Nakhlah Ash-Shamiyah flowing from the eastern slope of Jabal Al-Habla, then its water pushes east and north, and that valley is called in its journey different names, and Nakhlah Al-Yamaniyah taking the waters of Hada Taif and waters of Hablati As-Sa'id and Ath-Thabatah, then the two Nakhlahs meet, and the valley is called Wadi Az-Zubarah, with villages of Ubaydah: Az-Zubarah, Ar-Rayan, Al-Mubarak, Al-Qashashiyah, and large valleys join it like Wadi Marr from the north, Wadi Naba from the south, Wadi Alaf from the north also. When passing the village of Abi Husani called Wadi Fatimah, with many villages like Al-Juhud the capital of the valley, Daf Zaini, Daq Khuzaymah.

And large valleys pour into it like Sarf and Yajuj, and Fakh, all from the southern bank, its inhabitants today mixed people, in the two Nakhlahs upper for Thaqif and most for Hudhayl, and Wadi Az-Zubarah shared by Hudhayl and the Ashraf Al-Mana'imah and others mixed, and Wadi Fatimah almost for the Ashraf with few, but became shared by groups from Harb and others. And the valley also called Wadi Ash-Sharif because Sharif Abu Numay who ruled Makkah sixty years from 932-992 AH owned most of this valley so attributed to him. As for attributing to Fatimah she is the wife of Barakat ibn Abi Numay and his mother I don't remember now that. And attributing the valley to her like to Ash-Sharif, and it was said that in Marr Az-Zahran (300) springs, and I caught (36) springs. And most springs of Wadi Fatimah cut off, and remained springs of Wadi Az-Zubarah and the two Nakhlahs, cause of their cutoff drilling artesian in Abi Husani, its water extended to Jeddah which almost drinks waters of all surrounding valleys, in addition to sea waters. As for villages in Wadi Marr Az-Zahran today more than forty villages, and its length about two hundred and eight kilometers measuring its longest tributary Nakhlah Ash-Shamiyah, then pours into the sea south of Jeddah not far from it. And Marr Az-Zahran passes one short stage from Makkah north and (24) km on the road to Madinah Al-Munawwarah, and today some people of Makkah plot in it and dwell.

Ibn Ishaq said - in the news of Ghazwah Bani Al-Mustaliq - the Prophet raided Bani Al-Mustaliq from Khuzaymah in Sha'ban year six. Ibn Hisham said: Appointed over Madinah Abu Dharr Al-Ghifari and said: Numaylah ibn Abdullah Al-Laythi.

Said: These Quraysh, said: Who the sheikh in them? Said: Abdullah ibn Umar - the hadith. And in the Noble Quran His saying: (Enter Misr if Allah wills secure) Surah Yusuf verse 99, the interpreters differed in interpreting this verse regarding the inflection of (Misr) as differed in the intended by this verse, is it Misr the known country Misr Pharaoh? Or any misr from the amsar? Ibn Abbas preferred that the intended in this verse: any misr from the amsar they entered. And the interpreters did not differ in the other verses where Misr mentioned that the intended in them is Misr the known country, like His saying: Enter Misr if Allah wills secure Surah Yusuf verse 99. And Misr lands conquered in the caliphate of Amir Al-Mu'minin Umar ibn Al-Khattab on the hand of Amr ibn Al-As may Allah be pleased with him. Al-Baladhuri said: They said: And Amr ibn Al-As besieged Caesarea after the people's departure from the war of Al-Yarmuk, then deputized his son when Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan ruled, and went to Misr on his own, Umar angered for that, wrote rebuking him and reproaching him for his initiative in his opinion, and ordered him to return to his place until his letter reached him before Misr, the letter reached him at Al-Arish. Also said Umar wrote to Amr ibn Al-As ordering him to depart to Misr his letter reached him besieging Caesarea, and who came to him Sharik ibn Abdah, gave him thousand dinars Sharik refused acceptance, asked him to return that and not tell Umar. They said: Amr's march to Misr in year nineteen camped Al-Arish, then came Al-Farma' with people prepared for fight, fought them defeated them took their camp, proceeded forward to Al-Fustat, camped Hnan Ar-Raihan and the people of Al-Fustat trenched, the city's name was Al-Yuna, the Muslims named it Fustat; because they said: This the fustat of the people and their gathering, some say Amr pitched a fustat there so named by it. They said: Amr did not stay besieging the people of Al-Fustat until Az-Zubayr ibn Al-Awwam reached him with ten thousand, said twelve thousand among them Kharijah ibn Hudhafah Al-Adawi, and Umayr ibn Wahb Al-Jumhi, and Az-Zubayr intended ghazwah intending Antioch Umar said to him: O Abu Abdullah do you want the governorship of Misr, he said: No need for me in it, but I go out mujahid and helper for Muslims, if I find Amr conquered it I not interfere in his work and intend some coasts and garrison it, and if I find him in jihad I with him, proceeded on that. They said: Az-Zubayr fought from a direction, and Amr ibn Al-As from a direction, then Az-Zubayr brought a ladder ascended on it until topped the fortress, naked his sword magnified and Muslims magnified and followed him conquered the fortress by force and Muslims permitted what in it, Amr settled its people on that they dhimmis, placed on them jizyah on their necks and kharaj on their land, wrote that to Umar ibn Al-Khattab approved it, and Az-Zubayr traced in Misr and built a known house, and Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr stayed there when raided Africa with Ibn Abi Sarh, and Az-Zubayr handed over remained in Misr. Said: And Az-Zubayr sent to Misr said to him: In it stabbing and plague, he said: We came for stabbing and plague, they placed the ladders ascended on them. Said entered Amr ibn Al-As Misr with three thousand five hundred, and Umar ibn Al-Khattab feared what informed of its matter, sent Az-Zubayr ibn Al-Awwam with twelve thousand, Az-Zubayr witnessed conquest of Misr and traced in it. When conquered Misr without treaty Az-Zubayr stood said: Divide it O Amr, he refused, Az-Zubayr said: By Allah we divide it as the Prophet divided Khaybar, Amr wrote to Umar about that, Umar wrote to him: Leave it until raid from it the rope of the mountain. And confused for people the matter of Misr some said conquered by force, others by peace, Ubayd Allah ibn Amr said: My father came it its people fought opened it forcibly and entered Muslims it, Az-Zubayr first ascended its fortress, its owner said to my father: Reached us your work in Sham, and placing jizyah on Christians and Jews and leaving the land in their hands they cultivate it and pay its kharaj, if you do with us like that better for you than killing us and capturing us and expelling us, my father consulted Muslims, advised him to do that except a group asked him to divide the land between them, placed on every adult two dinars jizyah unless poor, and obligated every land owner with the two dinars three ardeb wheat and qist oil and qist honey and qist vinegar provision for Muslims gathered in the provision house and divided among them, and counted Muslims obligated people of Misr for every man from them woolen jubba and burnus or turban and trousers and shoes every year, or equivalent jubba Egyptian cloth and wrote for them with that a book, and conditioned for them if fulfilled that not sold their women and sons, not captured and their properties and treasures remain in their hands, wrote that to Amir Al-Mu'minin Umar approved it, became the land kharaj land, except that when this condition and book occurred some people thought it conquered by peace. And when the king of Al-Yuna finished his matter and those with him in his city reconciled for all people of Misr on like reconciliation of Al-Yuna. Accepted and said: These the fortified accepted and satisfied with this so we more satisfied; for we carpet no strength for us, and placed the kharaj on Misr land, made on every jarib dinar and three ardeb food, and on head of every adult two dinars and wrote that to Umar ibn Al-Khattab may Allah be pleased with him. Said: And Al-Muqawqis reconciled Amr ibn Al-As on that to depart from the Romans who wanted departure, and stay who wanted stay from the Romans on matter he named, and to impose on the Copts two dinars, reached the king of Romans angered it and sent the armies so closed the gate of Alexandria. Said: And when Amr finished sent Abdullah ibn Hudhafah As-Sahmi to Ain Shams, overcame its land and reconciled its villages' people on like rule of Al-Fustat, and sent Kharijah ibn Hudhafah Al-Adawi to Al-Qiyum and Al-Ashmuneen and Akhmim and Al-Bashrudat, and villages of As-Sa'id, did like that, and sent Umayr ibn Wahb Al-Jumhi to Tanis and Damietta and Tuna and Damirah and Shata and Daqahalah and Buna and Busir, did like that, and sent Uqbah ibn Amir Al-Juhani said his mawla Ward to the rest villages of lower land did like that, Amr ibn Al-As gathered the conquest of Misr, became also kharaj land. Amr ibn Al-As conquered Misr year twenty with Az-Zubayr ibn Al-Awwam, when conquered it its people reconciled on duty he imposed on them, it two dinars on every man, and took out women and children from that, its kharaj reached in his governorship two million dinars, after that reached four million dinars. And when Amr ibn Al-As finished Misr stayed in it, then wrote to Umar ibn Al-Khattab asking permission to march to Alexandria, wrote ordering him that, marched to it in year twenty one, deputized over Misr Kharijah ibn Hudhafah ibn Ghanim, and was before Alexandria from Romans and Copts gathered for him and said: We raid him at Al-Fustat before he reaches us and intends Alexandria, met them at Al-Karbun defeated them killed great killing from them, and among them from people of Sakha, and Balhayt, and Al-Khays, and Saltis, and others aided them and helped them, then Amr marched until reached Alexandria found its people prepared to fight him, except the Copts in that love reconciliation, sent to him Al-Muqawqis asking peace and truce to term, Amr refused that, Al-Muqawqis ordered the women to stand on the city's wall facing inside, and the men with weapons facing the Muslims to terrify them, sent to him Amr: We saw what you did, and not with multitude we were defeated, we met Heraclius your king so was his matter what was, Al-Muqawqis said to his companions: These people told truth, expelled our king from his kingdom until entered Constantinople, we more to submission, they abused him and refused but fighting, Muslims fought them severe fight besieged them three months, then Amr conquered it by sword, booty in it and spared its people did not capture made them dhimmis like people of Al-Yuna, wrote to Umar with the conquest with Mu'awiyah ibn Hudayj Al-Kindi then As-Sakuni, and sent with him the fifth. Said Al-Muqawqis reconciled Umar on thirteen thousand dinars, on to exit from Alexandria who wanted exit, and stay there who loved stay, and to impose on every adult from Copts two dinars wrote for them with that a book, then Amr deputized over Alexandria Abdullah ibn Hudhafah ibn Qays ibn Adi ibn Sa'd ibn Sahm ibn Amr ibn Husays ibn Ka'b ibn Lu'ayy in the garrison of Muslims, and returned to Al-Fustat, and the Romans wrote to Constantine son of Heraclius and the kingship then, informing him of the few who with them from Muslims and what they in of humiliation and paying jizyah sent a man from his companions called Manuel with three hundred ships loaded with fighters, entered Alexandria killed who in it from Muslim garrisons except who Allah facilitated for escape escaped, that in year twenty five, reached Amr the news marched to them with fifteen thousand, found their fighters went out ravaging what adjoins Alexandria from villages of Misr, Muslims met them shot them with arrows hour, Muslims shielded then confirmed the charge the war engaged between them, fought severe fight, then those infidels turned defeated, no direction nor deviation for them except Alexandria fortified in it and installed catapults Muslims fought them severest fight, installed mangonels destroyed its walls, and insisted the war until entered it by sword by force killed the fighters and captured the offspring, some Romans escaped to the Romans, and killed their number Manuel, and Amr and Muslims demolished the wall of Alexandria, and Amr vowed if conquered it to do that. And some narrators said: This raid was in year twenty three, and some narrated they breached in year twenty three, and year twenty five, Allah knows best. I say with this Islamic conquest Misr became Islamic Arab country, and had political and cultural and economic fame, and its fame and status remain to this era, and authored in its history special compositions ancient and modern, and for this Islamic Arab country fame, and for its history comprehensive sources I suffice with this amount of talking about it.","Translation":"This story talks about Egypt's conquest by Amr bin Al-As, may God be pleased with him, in 20 Hijri, starting conquering Babylon fortress then to Al-Fustat.

Said: And first who built fortress Al-Masisah in Islam Abd Al-Malik ibn Marwan by his son Abdullah ibn Abd Al-Malik in year eighty four on its old foundation, completed its building and furnished it in year eighty five, and in the fortress a church made hermitage, and the outposts from Antioch would ascend to it every year winter there then depart. Umar ibn Abd Al-Aziz proceeded until camped Hara Al-Masisah, wanted to demolish it and demolish the fortresses between it and Antioch, said: I hate the Romans besiege its people, people informed him that it only populated to defend from the Romans Antioch, and if evacuated the enemy no end before Antioch, so withheld and built for its people a congregational mosque from the direction of Kafr Bayya, and made in it a cistern, and his name written on it, then the mosque ruined in the caliphate of Al-Mu'tasim Billah and it called Masjid Al-Hisn.

Ibn Jarir said: Says the Messenger of Allah and those who pledged the pledge of Ridwan: (And He it is who withheld their hands from you) meaning: Allah withheld the hands of the polytheists who went out on the Prophet's camp at Al-Hudaybiyah seeking their lapse to hit from them, so the Prophet sent came with them captives, released them and favored them did not kill them, so Allah said to the believers: And He who withheld the hands of these polytheists from you and your hands from them in the valley of Makkah, after He gave you victory over them. Narrated from Abdullah ibn Mughaffal that the Prophet was sitting at the root of a tree at Al-Hudaybiyah, on his back a branch from the tree's branches so I raised it from his back, and Ali ibn Abi Talib before him, and Suhayl ibn Amr and he the owner of the polytheists, so the Prophet said to Ali: Write in the name of Allah the Merciful the Compassionate so Suhayl held his hand said: We do not know the Merciful write in our judgment what we know, the Prophet said: Write in your name O Allah so wrote said: <<This what reconciled Muhammad the Messenger of Allah the people of Makkah>>. Suhayl held his hand, said: We wronged you if you messenger, write in our judgment what we know said: Write this what reconciled Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abd Al-Muttalib and I the Messenger of Allah, went out to us thirty youths with them weapons so jumped in our faces the Prophet invoked against them, Allah took their sights we rose to them took them, the Prophet said to them: Did you go out in security of anyone said: Released them, said: So Allah revealed (And He it is who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Makkah after He gave you victory over them). Al-Bukhari narrated from Abu Shurayh that he said to Amr ibn Sa'id while sending the dispatches to Makkah: Permit me O prince, tell you a saying the Prophet stood with it the morrow from the day of conquest I heard it my ears, and my heart comprehended it and my eyes saw it when spoke it praised Allah and extolled Him then said: Indeed Makkah Allah forbade it and people did not forbid it, not lawful for a man believes in Allah and the Last Day to spill blood in it, nor cut tree in it if anyone permitted for fighting the Messenger of Allah in it say: Indeed Allah permitted for His Messenger and did not permit for you, and only permitted for me an hour from day, then returned its sanctity today as its sanctity yesterday, and let the present convey to the absent. Yaqut said: Ibn Al-Anbari said: Named Makkah because it crushes the tyrants, removes their pride, and said: Because people crowd in it from saying: The foal imtaka the udder of its mother if sucked it strongly. And named Bakkah for people's crowding in it. Abu Ubaydah recited: When the drinker takes it akkah leave him until he bakka bakkah. Said: Makkah name of the city, and Bakkah name of the House. Others said Makkah is Bakkah and the meem substitute for ba as said: Not this with strike lazib and lazim. Abu Al-Qasim said: This what Abu Bakr mentioned in Makkah. Ash-Sharqi ibn Al-Qutami said: Only named Makkah; because Arabs in Jahiliyyah would say: Our hajj not complete until we come to the place of the Ka'bah and mak in it, meaning: whistle the makaa whistle around the Ka'bah, and they would whistle and clap their hands when circumambulate it, and Al-Makaa with tashdid kaf: bird resorts to the meadows, an Bedouin said: Arrived Al-Hadr saw makkaa crying so longed for his land said: O this makkaa what you here no laa nor shih so where you lay eggs ascend to land of makaki and avoid villages of Sham not become ill while you sick. And Al-Makaa with takhfif kaf and mad: the small so as if they imitate the sound of makaa, and if the whistle the purpose not was lightened. Some said: Named Makkah because between two high mountains on it, and it in a depression like the makkuk, and Al-Makkuk Arabic or Arabized Arabs spoke it, came in the poetry of the eloquent. Al-A'sha said: And the makkaki and the plates from silver, and the emaciated under the saddles. Said: As for their saying: Named Makkah for people's crowding in it from saying the foal imtaka what in the udder of its mother if sucked it strongly mistake in interpretation, not resemble the foal's sucking the camel people's crowding and but two sayings: Said: Named Makkah for people's gathering in it, and said also: Named Makkah; because it enslaves people in it so they come to it from all sides from saying imtaka the foal the teats of the camel if pulled all in it pulling not leave in it anything, and this saying of linguists. Others said: Named Makkah; because no one commits outrage in it but his neck twisted, so becomes morning his neck twisted. Ash-Sharqi narrated that Bakkah name of the village, and Makkah aim with Dhi Tuwa not seen by one who passed from people of Sham and Iraq and Yemen and Basrah, but it houses at the bottom of Dhi Tuwa. Others Bakkah place of the House and what around the House Makkah, said: And these five sayings in Makkah other than what Ibn Al-Anbari mentioned. Said: Ubayd Allah the needy to Him found that only named Makkah from mak the breast, meaning suck it, for scarcity of its water; because they would imtak the water meaning extract it and said: That it mak the sins as the foal mak the udder of its mother not leave in it anything. Said: Named Makkah; because it mak who wronged meaning diminish him, and recites some: O mak the wicked mak makk and not mak Mudhaj and Akk. Narrated from Mughirah ibn Ibrahim said: Bakkah place of the House, and place of the village Makkah. From Yahya ibn Abi Anisa said: Bakkah place of the House, and Makkah the sanctuary all. Zayd ibn Aslam said Bakkah the Ka'bah and the mosque, and Makkah Dhi Tuwa and it the valley's belly which Allah mentioned in Surah Al-Fath, and it has names other than that and it: Makkah, and Bakkah, and An-Nasasa, and Umm Raham, and Umm Al-Qura, and Ma'ad, and Al-Hatimah; because it crushes who belittled it, and named the House Al-Atiq; because it freed from the tyrants. And Ar-Ra's because like the head of man, and Al-Haram, and Salah Al-Balad Al-Amin, and Al-Arsh, and Al-Qadis; because it purifies from sins meaning cleanses, and Al-Muqaddasah, and An-Nasiyah, and Al-Basah, with single ba; because it bas meaning crushes the atheists, said expels them, and Kawtha with name of spot was dwelling of Bani Abd Ad-Dar, and Al-Madhhab in Bishr ibn Abi Khazim's saying: And what contained the sanctuaries of the praying and Al-Madhhab. And Allah named it Umm Al-Qura, said: (To warn Umm Al-Qura and who around it) Surah Ash-Shura verse 7, and named it Al-Balad Al-Amin in His saying: (By the fig and the olive and Mount Sinai and this secure city) Surah At-Tin verse 1-3, and said Almighty: (I swear by this city and you resident in this city) Surah Al-Balad verse 1-2, and said Almighty: (And let them circumambulate the ancient House) Surah Al-Hajj verse 29, and said Almighty: (Allah made the Ka'bah the sacred House an establishment for people) Surah Al-Ma'idah verse 97, and said Almighty on the tongue of Ibrahim: (My Lord make this city secure and keep me and my sons away from worshiping) Surah Ibrahim verse 35, and said also on the tongue of Ibrahim: (Our Lord I settled some of my offspring in a valley without cultivation near Your sacred House) Surah Ibrahim verse 37, and when the Prophet went out from Makkah stood at Al-Hazzwarah said: I know you the dearest land to me, and you the dearest land of Allah to Allah, and if not the polytheists expelled me from you I not went out. I say: For the importance of Makkah for Muslims authored in its history many compositions talking about its history from all sides, from the most famous (Book Akhbar Makkah for Al-Azraqi), and (Book Akhbar Makkah for Al-Fakihi), and (Book Shifa Al-Gharam bi Akhbar Al-Balad Al-Haram for Al-Fasi), and others from the compositions.

Al-Asadi said: And on three miles from Ar-Rawha' meaning and you intending Makkah - mosque for the Prophet in the document of the mountain, called Masjid Al-Mansarif, mountain to your left you deviate from it in the road. Hamd Al-Jasir said: And this place where the mosque called now (Al-Musayjid) large village, and from it anciently deviates the road left to Ar-Ruwaythah, while directs from it the road of As-Safra' then Badr directly.

I say: This what the scholars mentioned in identifying Al-Mansarif Ar-Rawha' its site and the distance between it and Madinah and reason of naming it this name, as appears that this place its name changed and became inhabited town in this era called (Al-Musayjid) and some clarified reason of this change and naming it this name, Allah knows best.","Translation":"This story talks about Al-Mansarif mosque, now known as Al-Musayjid, place between Medina, Al-Ruwaythah, Al-Rawha', and Al-Sayalah on road to Mecca.

I say: Najd famous lands in dictionaries, and history books, and poets much mentioned it and described its spots mountains and valleys and meadows and darat and waters and hills and others, and I will talk about its boundaries from sayings of dictionary owners and researchers, and Najd name for number of scattered lands in Arabian Peninsula, but widest and most famous Najd Al-Hijaz, and it the one I will talk about, and Yaqut mentioned multiple places each called a Najd, and identified some, some not identified. Yaqut said: An-Nadr said: Al-Najd the qafafs of earth and its solids and what thickened from it and rose, and the group Al-Nujad, and only be qaf or solidity from the earth in height from the mountain transversely before you returns your side from what behind it, said: Ascend those the Najad and that the Najad facing. Said: Not the severe height. Al-Asma'i said: It nujuds several, from them: Najd Barq valley wadi at Al-Yamamah, and Najd Khal, and Najd Afr, and Najd Kabkab, and Najd Mari', said: And all what rose above Tihamah so Najd, so it grazes at Najd, and drinks at Tihamah. Al-Asma'i said: And I heard Al-Bahili say: All what behind the ditch that Kisra ditched, said: Najd is the wide land whose upper Tihamah and Yemen, and lower its Iraq and Sham. As-Sukkari said: Limit Najd Dhat Irq from the side of Hijaz, as the mountains turn with it to the mountains of Madinah and what behind Dhat Irq from the mountains to Tihamah so all Hijaz, so if cut off the mountains from the direction of Tihamah so what behind it to the sea so Al-Ghawr, and Al-Ghawr and Tihamah one. Ammarah ibn Aqil said: What flowed from Dhat Irq facing so it Najd until it cuts it Iraq, and limit Najd lower parts of Hijaz, and what flowed from Dhat Irq turning to the west so it Hijaz until it cuts it Tihamah, and Hijaz yahjiz meaning cuts between Tihamah and Najd. I say: This some what Yaqut mentioned from sayings in identifying Najd. Al-Bakri said: As for Najd so what between Jarsh to Suwad Al-Kufah, and its last limit adjoining the west the two Hijazs Hijaz Al-Aswad, and Hijaz Madinah, and Al-Hijaz Al-Aswad Sarat Shanwa'ah, and from the east Persian Sea between Oman to swamp of Basrah, and from the right of qiblah the Shami: Al-Hazn Hazn Al-Kufah, and from Al-Udhayb to Ath-Tha'labiyah to Qalah Bani Yarbu' to the left of the ascender to Makkah, and from the left of qiblah the Yamani what between work of Yemen to swamp of Basrah. Ammarah ibn Aqil said: What flowed from Al-Harrah: All what behind the ditch ditch of Kisra, which he ditched on Suwad Iraq, it Najd until turn to Al-Harrah, so if turned to Al-Harrah you in Hijaz until it sinks, and Al-Ghawr all what its flow descended west, so thereby named Al-Ghawr, and all what leveled east so it Najd. Al-Bakri said: And Dhat Irq separation what between Najd and Tihamah and Hijaz, said to people of Dhat Irq: Mutahammum you or munjidun? Not mutahammum nor munjidun, the poet said: And we at plain elevated not munjid nor mutahamm so the eye with tear flows. Al-Hasan Al-Isfahani cited saying of Ammarah ibn Aqil: What flowed from Harrah Bani Salim and Harrah Layla so it Al-Ghawr, until it cuts it the sea, and what flowed from Dhat Irq west so it Hijaz until it cuts it Tihamah, and it black Hijaz, separates between Najd and Tihamah, and what flowed from Dhat Irq facing so it Najd until it cuts it Iraq. I say: What preceded the most famous sayings in identifying Najd, and they sayings agreed in their concept, and some complete some. They see that Najd from the linguistic side name for the elevated land. As for from the geographical side they see that boundaries of Najd start from slopes of mountains of Hijaz the eastern, and extend east to Basrah and west Iraq, and with more general wording: it the wide land whose upper Tihamah and Yemen, and lower Iraq and Sham. Arabs realized with their instinct and experience the slope of their lands from west, and southwest to east, and northeast so divided Najd into two parts: Upper and Lower, and said for who travels from its east to its west: Mus'id, and for who travels from its west to its east Munjid, and these concepts still known practiced among general people of Najd, and the upper what adjoined Hijaz and Tihamah. I say: On light of this phrase that divided Najd into two parts, western and eastern, can say: What pushed elevations of Al-Yamamah and what adjoined it south and north west it the upper, and what descended from Al-Yamamah and what adjoined it north and south east so it the lower. As for Yaqut he identified upper Najd with dwellings of the tribes that inhabit it, and it good identification in time of those tribes, but needs two things: knowledge of ancient tribes dwellings first, and the movements occurred on them second. Yaqut said some said: The upper what passed it Ar-Rimah to Makkah, and they Akl and Tamim, and group from Bani Dabbah, and Amir all, and Bahilah, and groups from Bani Asad, and Abdullah ibn Ghatafan, and from its eastern side Aban ibn Darim and they upper, and people of Imarah from Bani Asad and their elders, and group from Awf ibn Ka'b ibn Sa'd ibn Sulaym, and Ujaz Huwayzin, and Muharib all and Ghatafan all, upper Najdi. And from people of Hijaz who not Najdi nor Ghawri, and they: Al-Ansar and Muzaynah, and who mixed them from Kinanah who not from people of the sea between Khaybar to Al-Arj what adjoins it from Al-Harrah. So if descended to slopes of Al-Arj and passes of Dhat Irq so you in them. And said: Upper the man and a'la if came upper Najd, man mu'al also, Bishr ibn Abi Khazim said: Upper not fear except muhjar and Harrah Layla the plain from it and its lowb if the upper wind blew and found me delights for the upper wind my heart and if the east wind blew stirred the people agonies of sorrow not find healer to other from the poetry that contain like these meanings and express them, and talking about Najd and what said in it from poetry long needs special composition. As for Najd in what the later wrote: The later not differ from the early except in the eastern and northern boundaries of Najd, they see its eastern boundaries end with Ad-Dahna', and northern boundaries end with An-Nafud Al-Kabir, and possible they were influenced by what general people agreed on in this era, or identified it on light of political developments in Najd. Mustafa Ad-Dabbagh said Najd plateau includes the central region from Arabian Peninsula, and slopes gradually toward east and north, and extends from Nafud desert in north to Ar-Rub' Al-Khali in south, and from borders of Al-Ahsa east to borders of Hijaz and Asir west. Fu'ad Hamzah said the word (Najd) applied on the elevated land and used term to indicate the central region of Arabian Peninsula, and it the region located east Hijaz to Ad-Dahna' in east, differed the Arab geographers in identifying the place where Najd starts from the side of Hijaz, but the recognized that it starts from Dhat Irq Nakhlah( and it place distant from Wadi As-Sil the famous in Hijaz few miles, and said: That who saw Hazn so has entered Najd. But we apply it on the region located between degree 27 north latitude, and between degrees 43, 47 east longitude, the identification includes the land bounded by Jabal Shammar from north, and region of Hijaz plateaus east of Hijaz mountains chain and Asir from west, and the great desert (Ar-Rub' Al-Khali) from south, and Ad-Dahna' separating Najd and Al-Hasa from east. And in book Geography of the Arab Homeland and to the east from elevations of Hijaz exists Najd plateau, and its meaning: The elevated land, and bounded from north Nafud desert, from south Ar-Rub' Al-Khali, and to its north Jabal Shammar, and separates it Wadi Ar-Rimah from rest lands of Najd. And Najd plateau slopes gradually toward plains of Al-Ahsa, and in north Najd exist the sand dunes known as An-Nafud, and it extends south until Ar-Rub' Al-Khali and connects with Ad-Dahna' desert. Umar Rida Kahalah said as for the part located east of Sarawat mountains called Najd, and consists of areas far-flung differing shapes and attributes, and extends from slopes of Sarawat mountains to Ad-Dahna', which separates between it and coast of Arabian Gulf, and the mountainous parts that rise above the general level of the region called Najd, almost confined to Jabalay Tay' (Aja and Salma). And Najd divides a chain of mountains called Al-Arid directed from north to south in curved shape approximately, as for the plains and sands and deserts surrounding it they the Najdi plains, and An-Nafud Al-Kabir and Ad-Dahna' and Ar-Rub' Al-Khali, and they vast deserts. I say: These sayings most important what I viewed from what the later wrote in identifying lands of Najd, and these sayings agreed in their geographical indication description and identification, except what Fu'ad Hamzah said, in the northern boundaries of Najd, he differed with others, where sees that Jabalay Tay' outside boundaries of Najd, while others see that Najd bounded from north by An-Nafud Al-Kabir, and that Jabalay Shammar inside boundaries of Najd, and no preference for what Fu'ad Hamzah said, since the known ancient, and agreed on in this era that lands of the two mountains Aja and Salma - inside and counted from lands of Najd. As for Muhammad ibn Bulayhid he not talked about Najd in terms of description and identification, sufficed with saying: Najd known and its fame sufficient identifying it. Said in another place from his book and Al-Yamamah: Mountain transverse in Najd the eastern, as Amr ibn Kulthum said in its description and but describes its western face the sheer. (As swords in hands of unsheathed us) I say: Notice from his saying that he sees that mountain of Al-Yamamah (Tuwaiq) located in eastern Najd. And poets of Arabs ancient and modern much mentioned Najd, its landmarks, and deserts and meadows and darat and valleys and ghudran and trees, and herbs, and breezes of its night, and clarity of its day, and longed to it, and yearned to its groves. And Yaqut cited in his dictionary a group from this poetry, from it saying of one of the Bedouins: I repeat my glance toward Najd and though I to it and if not the glance reaches longing to land as if its soil if rained oud and musk and amber birds anemone in its meadow and flowers of anemones embroidered cold garment I long to land of Hijaz and my need tents at Najd behind it the glance shortens and what my look from toward Najd benefits me yes no but I to that look oh every day glance then tear for your eyes its water's course flows when rests the heart either neighbor experienced, or distant remembering to other from the poetry that contain like these meanings and express them, and talking about Najd and what said in it from poetry long needs special composition.","Translation":"This story talks about Najd lands, vast area in Arabian Peninsula. Historians and dictionary owners differed determining borders east, west, north, south. Some opinions indicate starts from Hijaz mountains' eastern slopes extending east to Al-Dahna'. Area between northern latitude 27 and eastern 43, including Shammar mountain, Nafud desert, and Empty Quarter. Also Arab poets often mentioned Najd in poetry, reflecting people's love and attachment to this land."},{"Place":"Najran","City":"South of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","Description":"Al-Bukhari narrated from Hudhayfah may Allah be pleased with him said: The Prophet said to people of Najran: I will send to you trustworthy truly trustworthy, so his companions looked forward, so sent Abu Ubaydah may Allah be pleased with him. Yaqut said Najran with fath then sukun, and ending noon... and Najran in several places, from them: Najran in Mukhalif Al-Yaman from the direction of Makkah they said: Named with Najran ibn Zaydan ibn Saba' ibn Yashjub ibn Ya'rub ibn Qahtan; because he first who populated it and settled it, and he the Mur'if... As for entering its people in Christianity religion, Ibn Ishaq said: Narrated Al-Mughirah ibn Labid mawla Al-Akhnas from Wahb ibn Munabbih Al-Yamani that he narrated them that the site of that religion at Najran was that a man from remnants of people of religion of Jesus called Faymiyun with fa and narrated with qaf, and was righteous man diligent in worship answered supplication, and was wandering resides in villages, if known in a village went out from it to another, and not eat except from earning of his hands and was builder works in mud, and respected Sunday not work in it anything goes out to wasteland from the land prays in it until evening, so noticed his matter a man from people of a village in Sham was Faymiyun working his work in it, and that man named Salih so Salih loved him severe love followed him wherever went and Faymiyun not notice him, until went out once Sunday to wasteland from the land as used to do and Salih followed him sat from him eye's view hidden from him, Faymiyun stood praying so came toward him dragon, and it the great snake, when Faymiyun saw it invoked against it died and Salih saw it not know what afflicted it feared for him screamed: O Faymiyun the dragon came toward you, not turn to him and attended his prayer until finished from it, Salih went out to him and said: O Faymiyun servant from servants of Allah afflicted him what you see, invoke Allah for him, invoked for him stood the boy no harm in him, Faymiyun knew he known went out from the village Salih followed him until stepped some lands of Arabs attacked them took them captives a caravan from Arabs went out with them until sold them at Najran, and people of Najran then on religion of Arabs worship great palm for them among them, for it festival every year if that festival hung on it every good cloth found and women's jewelry, went out to it a day camped on it a day, Faymiyun bought a man from their nobles, and Salih another, Faymiyun when stood at night in house his master housed him in it his master the house lit for him light until morning without lamp, his master marveled what saw from him asked him about his religion informed him and said to him Faymiyun: Indeed you on falsehood and this tree not harm nor benefit, and if I invoked on it my God whom I worship to destroy it, and He Allah alone no partner, his master said do, for if you did that we enter your religion and leave what we on, Faymiyun stood purified prayed two rak'ahs then invoked Allah on it Allah sent wind uprooted it from its root threw it so then followed him people of Najran carried them on the law from religion of Jesus son of Mary, then entered on them the events entered on others from people of their religion in every land, from here was Christianity in Najran from land of Arabs. So marched to them Dhu Nuwas with his soldiers invited them to Judaism and gave them choice between that and killing dug for them trenches and kindled them fire, then invited them to Judaism who refused threw him in the trenches, so in Dhu Nuwas and his soldiers Allah revealed: (Killed were the companions of the ditch (4) The fire full of fuel (5) When they were sitting over it (6) And they to what they do to the believers witnesses (7)) Surah Al-Buruj verses 4-7. I say: This some what Yaqut mentioned in his talking about Najran, and talked about it and mentioned another way for this news. Al-Baladhuri talked about reconciliation of Najran said: Narrated Bakr ibn Al-Haytham said: Narrated Abdullah ibn Salih from Al-Layth ibn Sa'd ibn Yunus Al-Ayli, from Az-Zuhri said: Came the Sayyid and Al-Aqib delegates of people of Najran Al-Yaman, asked him reconciliation, reconciled them for people of Najran on two thousand hullah in Safar, and thousand hullah in Rajab, value each hullah ounce, and the ounce weight forty dirham, if paid hullah with what above the ounce counted for them its excess, and if paid it with what below the ounce took from them the deficiency, and on to take from them what gave from weapons or horses or rides or merchandise from merchandises with its value deduction from the hullahs, and on to host messengers of the Messenger of Allah month or below, not detain them above month, and on them loan thirty shields and thirty horses and thirty camels if was in Yemen deceit, and what perished from that loan the messengers guarantors for it until return it, and made for them protection of Allah and His covenant, and not tempt them from their religion and their ranks in it, not gathered nor tithed, and conditioned on them not to eat usury nor deal with it. Narrated Al-Husayn ibn Al-Asad, narrated Waki' said: Narrated Mubarak ibn Fudalah, from Al-Hasan said: Came monks of Najran to the Prophet offered him Islam said: We Islam before you said: You lied, prevents you from Islam three: Eating you the pig, and worshiping you the cross, and saying you Allah child, said: So who father of Jesus? - Al-Hasan said: And was not hasten until his Lord orders him, Allah revealed: (That We recite to you from the signs and the wise reminder) to His saying Almighty: (The liars) Surah Al Imran verse 61 so the Prophet recited it to them, then called them to mubahalah and took by hand Fatimah and Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, one said to his companion ascend the mountain and not mubahalah him, for if mubahalah him hit with curse, said: So what you see? Said: I see we give him the tribute and not mubahalah him. I say: And reconciled them the Prophet on the tribute and wrote for them with that a book, and when the Prophet passed away Abu Bakr approved them on that. When Umar ibn Al-Khattab took over they dealt usury and increased, feared them on Islam expelled them and wrote for them: As for after so who fell to him from people of Sham and Iraq let expand for them from cultivation of land, and what they work from thing it for them place land in Yemen. So dispersed some settled in Sham, some Al-Najraniyah near Al-Kufah and by them named. This what Al-Baladhuri mentioned about delegation of Najran reconciliation and what their matter became in caliphate of Umar ibn Al-Khattab may Allah be pleased with him. Al-Himyari said: Najran district from lands of Yemen, named with Najran ibn Zayd ibn Saba' ibn Yashjub ibn Ya'rub ibn Qahtan. And who in the interval companions of the ditch, and they at Najran, reached Dhu Nuwas that people at Najran on religion of Messiah, and he Jew marched to them himself, dug for them ditches and kindled them fire, then invited them to Judaism who refused threw him in the ditches, brought a woman with her child son seven months refused to return from her religion, feared when neared the fire Allah spoke the child said: Proceed on your religion no fire after it, threw in the fire, Allah empowered on them the Abyssinians and overcame them on land of Yemen until was from matter Ibn Dhi Yazan and his seeking protection with Kisra Anushirwan what was. And at Najran was Abdullah ibn Ath-Thamir from people of religion of Jesus, and was in it remnants from people of his religion on the Gospel people of virtue and straightness, and Abdullah ibn Ath-Thamir head for them, and was origin of that religion at Najran, with Arabs were owners of idols, that man from remnants of that religion called Faymiyun fell among them carried them on it so followed him, and was righteous diligent ascetic in the world answered supplication. I say: Then exhausted in his talking news of the righteous man Faymiyun and his companion Salih as Yaqut cited in his dictionary I say: And city of Najran famous city in south of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and one of its administrative provinces, in it the administration center and affiliated to it number of governorates and centers, and took its share from urban and social growth in this era, as took other provinces of the Kingdom, and built the roads leading to it from various cities and villages, and established in it air airport connects it with Riyadh and Jeddah and others from cities of the Kingdom and since this city has fame in its past and present, I suffice with this amount of talking about it. And Yaqut mentioned that Najran from the shared names named with it number of places said: And Najran also place on two days from Al-Kufah between it and Wasit on the road, said: That Christians of Najran when expelled resided this place, named with name of their town. And Najran also: place at Al-Bahrayn as said. And Najran also: place at Hawran from environs of Damascus, and it great inhabited church beautiful built on marble columns adorned with mosaics.","Translation":"This story talks about Najran, known city south Saudi Arabia, named after righteous man Faymiyun.

Al-Bukhari narrated from Jabir said: We with the Prophet at Nakhl mentioned prayer of fear. Al-Waqidi said: Sariyyah Zayd ibn Harithah to Bani Salim at Al-Jumum, in Rabi' Al-Akhir year six for Hijrah... Al-Jumum what between Batn Nakhl and An-Naqrah. Yaqut mentioned that Nakhl name for two places, said: Nakhl with fath then sukun, name genus of the palm tree: station from stations of Bani Tha'labah from Madinah on two stages, said: Place at Najd from land of Ghatafan mentioned in Ghazat Dhat Ar-Riqa', and place in the way of Sham from the direction of Misr, mentioned it Al-Mutanabbi said: Passed by Nakhl and in her caravan from the worlds and from it carelessness. Said in explaining saying of Kathir: And how obtains Al-Hajibiyah the thousand at night its evening and passed Nakhl? Nakhl station for Bani Murrah ibn Awf on two nights from Madinah, Zuhayr said: And I giver from praise and eulogy to majestic remains to him the surpluses I connect to it dead at Nakhl and seek your brotherhood with the saying which I saying. I say: No contradiction between the sayings Yaqut mentioned in identifying Nakhl which located on two nights from Madinah, all sayings correct. Al-Bakri said: Nakhl on wording collect palm tree, Ya'qub said: It village said to it Wadi Shadkh for Fazarah and Ashja' and Anmar and Quraysh and Ansar, Ibn Habib said: It for Fazarah Bani Awf on two nights from Madinah. As-Sukuni said: It water between Al-Qassah and Ath-Thamiliyah, and by it descends the collector who collects greens of Muharib... And at Nakhl lost Sinan ibn Abi Harithah Al-Murri, not found after, their poet said: Indeed the riders seek Dha Murrah at south Nakhl if the months crescented. Hamd Al-Jasir said in his comment on Kathir's poetry: Nakhl: Known by name Al-Hanakiyyah, valley in it many villages, and by it passes road of Hail to Madinah. Al-Biladi said: Nakhl large valley many doom trees takes the flood of An-Nakhil - one of its tributaries - then pushes in Wadi Al-Khanaq from north - see Al-Hanakiyyah - meets with many valleys from them: Wadi Ash-Shaqrah, and Wadi Najar, and Wadi Mukhayt in place called Al-Makhalit, where their waters mix, then push in Al-Khanaq. And in Al-Hanakiyyah entry said: Hijazi town inhabited advanced, located on road of Al-Qassim from Madinah Al-Munawwarah on (100) km, its inhabitants tribe Harb. I say: This what the scholars mentioned in identifying Nakhl, also said to it Batn Nakhl; because wide abundant has spacious belly, and what the scholars and researchers mentioned in describing this valley and the village arose in it sayings some complete some, and this valley became called Al-Hanakiyyah, not known by its ancient name, and it famous valley cut it on the road and you going from lands of Al-Qassim to Madinah Al-Munawwarah, and famous by its name Al-Hanakiyyah. This Nakhl mentioned in the noble hadith, and it the located two nights from Madinah east. And from what preceded appears that Nakhl also name of the place on road of Sham on direction of Misr to Madinah, and it mentioned in Kathir's poetry. Muhammad ibn Bulayhid said and Nakhl remains on its name to this era, if ascended on Wadi Al-Hanakiyyah and left Rahrahan north of you turn right and go less than hour reach Wadi Nakhl, and from them who diminishes it calls it (An-Nakhil) and it pours in Wadi Al-Hanakiyyah, located from it in the eastern direction. I say: Wadi An-Nakhil - diminutive of An-Nakhl - famous valley in this era, inhabited with inhabitants and agriculture, and one of the tributaries of Wadi Nakhl, preceded that in what Al-Biladi mentioned.","Translation":"This story talks about a valley called Nakhl, formerly known as Al-Hanakiyah east Medina about 100 kilometers.

Said prevented between us and news of heaven and sent on us the meteors, said not prevented between you and news of heaven except something happened so strike easts of the earth and wests, see what this prevented between you and news of heaven, so those who directed toward Tihamah to the Prophet and he at Nakhlah intending Suq Ukaz. Ibn Hisham mentioned that the Prophet sent sariyyah led by Abdullah ibn Jahsh said sent the Prophet Abdullah ibn Jahsh ibn Ri'ab Al-Asadi in Rajab his return from first Badr, and sent with him eight men from Muhajirun, none from Ansar in them, and wrote for him a book and ordered not look in it until marches two days, then look in it, proceed for what ordered him, not force from his companions anyone. When Abdullah ibn Jahsh marched two days opened the book, looked in it so if in it when looked in this my book proceed until camp Nakhlah, between Makkah and Taif so watch there Quraysh and learn for us from their news, when Abdullah ibn Jahsh looked in the book, said: Hearing and obedience, then said to his companions: The Prophet ordered me to proceed to Nakhlah watch there Quraysh until bring him from them news, and forbade me to force any of you, so who from you desires martyrdom and desires it let go, and who hates that let return, as for me proceeding for order of the Messenger of Allah, proceeded and with him his companions, none lagged from him. Abdullah ibn Jahsh and his companions proceeded until camped at Nakhlah, passed by caravan of Quraysh carrying raisins and leather, and trade from Quraysh's trade in it Amr ibn Al-Hadrami, when the people saw them feared them camped near them, Ukkashah ibn Mihsan overlooked for them and had shaved his head, when saw him felt safe, said umar: No harm on you from them, the people consulted about them and that in last day from Rajab the people said: By Allah if left the people this night will enter the Haram, so protected from you in it, and if killed them will kill them in the forbidden month, the people hesitated and feared advancing on them, then encouraged themselves on them, and agreed on killing who they could from them, and taking what with them, shot Waqid ibn Abdullah At-Tamimi Amr ibn Al-Hadrami killed him, and captured Uthman ibn Abdullah, and Al-Hakam ibn Kaysan and the people escaped Nawfal ibn Abdullah eluded them, Abdullah ibn Jahsh and his companions came with the caravan and the two captives, until arrived to the Messenger of Allah at Madinah. Ibn Ishaq said: When arrived to the Messenger of Allah at Madinah, said I not ordered you fighting in the forbidden month, stopped the caravan and the two captives, refused to take from that anything, when the Messenger said that fell in the people's hands, thought they perished, and their brothers from Muslims reproached them in what did, Quraysh said: Muhammad and his companions permitted the forbidden month, spilled in it blood, and took in it properties, and captured in it men. When people much in that Allah revealed to His messenger: (They ask you about the forbidden month fighting in it say fighting in it great but averting from way of Allah and disbelief in Him and the Sacred Mosque and expelling its people from it greater with Allah) Surah Al-Baqarah verse 217, when the Quran descended with this from the matter, and Allah relieved the Muslims what were in of anxiety accepted the Messenger the caravan and the two captives, as for Al-Hakam ibn Kaysan Islam and good his Islam, stayed with the Messenger until killed day Bi'r Ma'unah martyr, as for Uthman ibn Abdullah joined Makkah died there infidel. When cleared for Abdullah ibn Jahsh and his companions what were in when the Quran descended, hoped for reward, said: O Messenger of Allah: Do we hope it be for us ghazwah we given in it reward of mujahids so Allah Almighty revealed in them: (Indeed those who believed and those who emigrated and strived in way of Allah those hope mercy of Allah and Allah Forgiving Merciful) Surah Al-Baqarah verse 218, so Allah placed them from that on greatest hope. I say: This summary of what Ibn Ishaq mentioned in his talking about sariyyah of Abdullah ibn Jahsh may Allah be pleased with him and his companions to Nakhlah. Yaqut said: Nakhlah Ash-Shamiyah two valleys for Hudhayl on two nights from Makkah meet at Batn Marr and Sabuhah, and it valley pours from Al-Ghamir, and Al-Yamaniyah pours from Qarn Al-Manazil and it on the way of Yemen their meeting Al-Bustan and it between their meetings, so if met were one valley in it Batn Marr, and them intended Kathir in his saying: Settled Umm Amr at Sadif love groves of Falj below them and Ash-Shaqa'iq urging morning of Al-Humr khus as if at Nakhlah from below Al-Wasif Al-Matarik indeed met us Umm Amr with true from separation or narrowed on him the ways. I say: Yaqut said that Nakhlah Ash-Shamiyah two valleys meet, and the fact that Nakhlah Ash-Shamiyah one valley, not two valleys, and Nakhlah Al-Yamaniyah also one valley flow in one direction then meet, as will come: Al-Bakri said: Nakhlah on wording one palm: place on night from Makkah, and it to which attributed Batn Nakhlah, and it which mentioned the hadith night of the jinn, and Ibn Wulan said: And they two Nakhlah Ash-Shamiyah, and Nakhlah Al-Yamaniyah, so Ash-Shamiyah: valley pours from Al-Ghamir, and Al-Yamaniyah valley pours from Batn Qarn Al-Manazil, and it way of Yemen to Makkah, so if met and were one valley, it Al-Masd, then joins them Batn Marr, and As-Sakhr recited: If your companions Bani Mu'awiyah people south Nakhlah Ash-Shamiyah not left me for the barking dogs. And at Nakhlah killed Amr ibn Al-Hadrami. Said Laghdah and from lands of Hudhayl, in way of Makkah Al-Mukarramah, from Makkah on two nights: two Nakhlahs, Nakhlah Al-Yamaniyah pours in it Yada'an, and it valley in it the Prophet's mosque, and by it camped Huwayzin day Hunayn, and Nakhlah Ash-Shamiyah: and their meeting Batn Marr, and Sabuhah valley pours in Nakhlah Al-Yamaniyah. Al-Fakihi said: Az-Zubayr ibn Abi Bakr narrated, Yahya ibn Muhammad narrated from Sulaym from Ibn Jurayj that he said: All Mina if descended from Muhassar what ascended in the belly of the channel so you in Mina to Al-Aqabah at Jamrat Al-Aqabah. Muhammad ibn Abi Umar narrated Abd Ar-Razzaq narrated Ma'mar from Muhammad ibn Al-Munkadir from Abu Hurayrah may Allah be pleased with him, said: Indeed the Messenger of Allah said: Mina all slaughter place, and lanes of Makkah all slaughter place. And with what I said: And with this Mina's site and boundaries appear, that Mina mash'ar from the sacred mash'ars frequented by Muslims every year to complete hajj rites, and has historical fame and Islamic fame known among Muslim scholars, and scholars much talked about it and all related to it from rulings, I suffice with this amount of talking about it. And Mina with the previous wording also said to it (Miniyah): large red mountain, and in it water descent, and it north of Jabal Hulayt, and northwest from town Nafi, and from landmarks of ancient Hima Dariyah, in lands of Ghunay, and mentioned by dictionary owners and identified it clearly, but differed in controlling its name, mentioned it with this name (Mina) and mentioned it with addition of haa (Miniyah) and some said with dammah awwal, some with kasrah, Al-Hijri said: Then adjoins Hulayt Mina, and it red great mountain not in the hama mountain taller than it, and overlooks what around it from mountains, and at its base water for Bani Zaban land of Ghunay, and mentioned it Labid said: Erased the dwellings its place then station at Mina became wild its ghawl then its stones. And Mina to the left of the road of Basrah people to Makkah for the ascender looks at it the pilgrim when they depart to Imarah before arriving it. In Wafa Al-Wafa: Liver of Mina qunah great single east of mountain called Miniyah, then hill Ar-Rayan. Al-Isfahani said: Ar-Rayan valley between mountains and sand, and Mina mountain. The poet said: Followed them an eye its human tears like the ring in the rippling of the tear's water until hidden in a pass and the camels in it from hill of Ghawl and from sides of Mina deviated. Yaqut said Mina wording of Mina the man: water near Dariyah, at the foot of red mountain, from mountains of Bani Kilab then for Ad-Dabab from them. Al-Hamdani said: Mina at Makkah not munawwan, and Mina munawwan from homes of Ghunay near Takhfah, and it in Hima Dariyah. I say: Liver of Mina called in this era: Miniyah As-Samra', and it black large qunah located northeast of Mina Al-Hamra' near it. I say: No disagreement in what the historians mentioned in describing mountain Miniyah and identifying its location, it near Takhfah and Hulayt and Ar-Rayan as well as from Dariyah. And in this era Mina located in lands of Ar-Rawqah from Utaybah affiliated to governorate of Ad-Dawadmi, distant from Dawadmi city north hundred km approximately.","Translation":"This story talks about Abdullah bin Jahsh's expedition to Nakhlah, valley east Mecca, confronting Quraysh tribe killing Amr bin Al-Hadrami.
